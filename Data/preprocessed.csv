great product at a great priceyoull pay 10 more for these anywhere else i was initially leery of buying another sd card on amazon 4 years ago i did so and the card was a fake said it had 32 gigs when plugged into the computer but you could only load about 11 onto it and it would say full apparently there is a way to fool your computer into thinking there is more space than there is and this is what the fakecounterfeit cards will donot so with this one it is the real deal genuine sandisk and contains as many gb as it says it does i am a very pleased customer,5.0

128 gb and 64 gb versions great but cannot confirm speed claims outside of the class ratingsupdate 62414my 128 gb card stopped allowing writes via any of my cardreaders on a windows pceither when it was inside any of several fullsize sd card adapters with the writeprotect tab in either position or plugged directly into the microsd slot of the reader microsd cards have no writeprotect tab so i was quite surprised and worried by this after failing to find any workable solution by searching online i finally put it in my chromebook and created a new folder on it there then stuck it back in my windows pc and it no longer gave me a writeprotect error if anyone has a similar problem i would recommend doing something similar by putting it in any other pc laptop camera and so on you have available and try writing to it therethis portion of my review is necessarily being written as an update to my original review of the 64 gb version of this card since amazon disallows multiple reviews for what they consider the same item this portion concerns the 128 gb version of this cardi do not need a fast card so the speeds on this card were not that important besides which my test pc is not exactly highend therefore i did not count off for the speed results i got below using a usb 20 card adapter but i thought they might be relevant to some readers while the card did reach the class10 andor uhsi requirements it came in at under 23 of the claimed read speeds up to 30 mbs for fast file transfer then again running on a second pc using a different usb 20 card reader none of the speeds even hit 5 mbs so this seems to be highly systemdependenti only just got the card this week and so far it works on select sdxccompatible devices and exfatcompatible operating systems some sdxccompatible devices such as the panasonic hdctm40 do not allow cards larger than 64 gb for whatever reason this was stated in the manual and i have confirmed this card is recognized as brokencorruptunusable in that device whereas 64 gb exfat cards work fine the 128 gb works fine with original exfat formatting in my toshiba excite 77 android tablet and predictably not at all in my nonsdxccompatible galaxy note 2 though it possibly would if reformatted to fat32 since a 64 gb card in fat32 works fine therei will update my review to reflect any problems issues and so on that i notice in the coming days weekscrystaldiskmark 303 c 20072013 hiyohiyocrystal dew world url removed as per amazon rules mbs 10 bytes sata300 30 bytessequential read 18694 mbssequential write 11921 mbsrandom read 512kb 18502 mbsrandom write 512kb 0680 mbsrandom read 4kb qd1 39 mbs 8151 iopsrandom write 4kb qd1 1581 mbs 3861 iopsrandom read 4kb qd32 3151 mbs 7694 iopsrandom write 4kb qd32 1564 mbs 3818 iopstest 10 mb g 00 001191 gb x5date 20140424 165349os windows xp professional sp3 51 build 2600 x86the following is my original review of the 64 gb version of this card published april 24 2013this is a highquality card i have used it in a variety of devices through multiple readers on different pcs in an hd camcorder using a micro to fullsized sd adapter and i have never once had a problem with it it even works at full capacity in some microsdhconly devices once its reformatted to fat32 such as my sandisk clip flac player and supposedly even psps via a proper adapter though i have not yet tested my psp i keep anticipating someone coming out with a card with equal or better capacity and speeds at a comparable price but i have not seen one yet if these were cheaper i would have several by nowmake sure your device can handle micro or fullsized sdxc cards or is one of those rare gems that state they support only as high as sdhc but have been tested to work with sdxc cards such as this one once they have been manually reformatted to fat32,5.0

works ok with the samsung galaxy tab 3 101lot of questions about this memory card fitting the samsung galaxy tab 3 101 tablet it fits and works no problem at all the only thing is that after installing instead of showing 64gb available it only shows 59gbtried formatting the card but with same resultshave no idea if this is a limit set by the the galaxy tab 3 tablet or is it just normal to buy 64gb and get less than thatas this is surely not a problem coming from the sandisk memory card my rating is a 5star excellent price works great and very quick delivery,5.0
samsung galaxy tab 3 101when it comes to any kind of flash storage sandisk has always been my go to brand because they sell quality items and stand by them if there is a problem so as usual no complaints here it works as descried and i have not have any issues both read and write speeds are right where the specs say they should be,5.0

very fast class 10 card and excellent service from amazonim amazed i ordered this from amazon on tuesday morning and it arrived with wednesdays mail very impressive service from amazonas has already been reported the card formats out to 59 gb and it performs perfectly in my samsung galaxy s i which is also new using two card readers on a fast pc i transferred everything from my old 16gb card to the new 64 gb card in less time than it took to walk to the kitchen and get a cup of coffee so i think the class 10 rating is correct on the cardonce i have some experience with the card in the phone i will benchmark the card and i will also benchmark operations such as internally backing up my android phone to the card then i will update this review with some accurate numerical data but in the mean time on first look the person who said that the s 3 has problems with anything faster than class 6 may not have been correct a full backup of the phone to the card was significantly faster than the backup with the old 16gb class 6 card again no benchmarks yet but once i have them i will include them hereright now i am very happy with this card and i am really impressed both with the card and with the unbelievably quick service from amazon and i am in atlanta where shipments like this one often take the full 3 days to arrive,5.0
greatexcellent one of the best cannot go wrong with this card class 10 is necessary and shows noticeable but not significant improvements over class 4,5.0
great quality plenty of memoryi bought the 64gb microsd card at best buy because i needed one for my microsoft surface pro it provides all the space i need and for people who need a lot of space videos quick books picture editing games and so on this card is the one for you if you do not need that much space consider buying one for cheaper with a little less memorynote be aware that this is a microsdxc format card while most new computers support this format many of the older computers do not this includes all but a few tablets and smartphones before buying this make sure your computer tablet or smartphone is compatible if it is not it will not work period for others who claim that the card does not work no matter what they try chances are their machine cannot support microsdxc format,5.0
fantastici got this because i just could not pass up the deal 1799 it has been incredibly fast in my htc sensation 4g pictures are taken and saved instantaneously only had it a few days but have been very happy shipping was fast and the packaging was easy to open which is always great in my book only issue i had was i had to format it on my computer first before my phone was able to recognize it,4.0

great item butuser instructions could be betterthe ultra micro sdhc was fine once i got it working neither the packaging nor the sansa clip player inform the user that the player needs to be totally off before the microcard is inserted if not the unit will not read the card otherwise love it and the storage for even 16 gb let alone 32 is tremendous,5.0
huge storagei upgraded to this after the price dropped i originally had a 16gig sandisk card and it was in my mytouch 4g i found toward my mytouch 4gs end of life that space is running low so when i got my galaxy s3 i bought this card it works flawlessly i highly recommend it now errors what so ever super fast transfer rate,5.0
sandisk micro sdthis item was priced right and fit right into my cell phone without any issues does what it is suppose to do and i do not know what else i could say being a class 10 it is suppose to be plenty fast for cell phone use which i am sure speeds up camera use to some degree has worked well and the shipping was fast,5.0
very fast and lots of storage with one catchi got this memory card for my samsung galaxy s3 i was running out of room on my sandisk 32gb class 4 micro sd card i also wanted a faster and more durable card i was hopping to put lots of media on it in addition to nandroid backups and custom roms i later found out that since this card is formatted in exfat it would not work to make nandroid backups or flash custom roms most custom recovery and custom roms dont work with exfat so my only choice was to format the card to fat 32 which meant i could not put any files larger than 4gb on it besides that this card is great and very reasonable price of 50 if your some one who does not root their phone or put custom roms nandroid backups or put files larger than 4gb than this will not affect you this memory card is fast and provides the most storage you can put on your mobile device at this time the card is also water proof shock proof and comes with lifetime warranty that is never had any issues with sandisk memory cards or usb flash drives they last a really long time,4.0

sandiski use this for my phone and it works just as it should and it was totally worth the money great place to store pictures and music for phones instead of using the phone memory so it will still run fast,5.0
fast but not with out headachsi bought two of these one for asus infinity and one for samsung galaxy s3 international version it worked fine with my asus but it did not work on my phone i formatted this card using the phonethe tablet and my laptop but did not work i did some tests with applications using some applications nothing showed its not working the only way i got it to work is by formatting it in my canon slr camera,4.0
painfully slowit works but the actual rw speeds are 188 mbs not even class 10 it should be marketed as sandisk basic not sandisk ultra unless they mean ultra slow now is 2014 and there is no excuse for such slow card from sandisk update i have redone the test with notepro 122 instead of using non uhsi pc and the latest results are 3286mbs since the read speed hits 30 i believe the device is dhsi ready still underwhelmed by the write speed though,2.0

ready for use on the galaxy s3update providing an update with regard to sandisk supporti bought the memory card in aug 2012 see original review below in may of 2013 while on my cruise to alaska the card went bad during the sailing out of san francisco it was fine as i used it to take a panorama shot of the golden gate bridge for most of the cruise i was using my dslr but the next time i wanted to use my cell phone the phone told me i had no memory card loaded any way tested the card on my laptop when i got back and it could not recognize it i contacted sandisk via email and provide them copy of my receipt from amazon along with the serial number on the back of the card very hard to read and no problems they told me to send them back the card and they sent me a brand new card which is now still functioning in my cell phone great support provide by sandisk no hassle as long as you can provide proof of purchase easy to do since amazon keeps my entire purchase historyinvoices online one reason i buy directly from amazon itself vs other vendors either on amazon or elsewhere on the internet is that i have confidence that the memory cards sold by amazon itself are genuine there may be incredible deals elsewhere on the internet but in some cases the deals are too good to be true and counterfeit cards are being soldoriginal reviewjust received this today removed it from the packaging and inserted it into my samsung galaxy s3 verizon and powered the unit back up and the storage was available no formatting required worked the first time out settings showed 2971gb of total space 32gb version and 2971gb of free space i like the fact that a sd adapter came with it should i ever need to insert the card into my laptop it will come in handy yes i can plug my phone directly to my laptop but if i ever swap this 32gb card out of my phone and replace it with a 64gb version i can use this 32gb version via the adapter for other purposes,5.0
great capasitystill do not feel is very fast or is just my phone i guess i will need to remove it and run some rw tests still its ok,3.0
did not work out for mei bought 64gb version of the card to use with gopro hero 3 black edition it did not work out the card worked ok if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates eg worked fine in 720p with protune on or 1080p with protune off however in 1080p with protune on bitrate is just shy of 6 mbs in this mode much higher then with protune turned off it was nothing but trouble camera would sometime work and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason i first suspected camera but testing with different sd cards it ended up being sandisks card that was at fault my spare card an old and cheap 16gb pny also class 10 worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settingsonce it was obvious it was problem with the card i found people on gopros forums that had trouble with this specific card as well well you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself right anyhow i did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of 1gb file full of zeros using unix dd utility to copy 1gb of zeros from devzero where else would you find that many zeros onto a file on the card the result was that on average sandisks card would manage about 102 mbs just barely above the bar for class 10 card however that was average over 1gb during the write test the speed was oscillating with many spikes and drops drops were as low as 7mbs uh i thought write speed of class 10 card should never dip below 10 mbs for comparison my old cheap class 10 pny card was chugging along at constant 13 mbs under the same test no spikes and no drops in speedthe card will probably work fine in most devices as bitrates when recording 1080p video are often low enough andor camera might have huge buffer but if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates and your device does not have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card you may run into trouble be wary of using it in hero3 in modes that have higher bit rates eg 1080p with protune enabledsandisks website lists part numbers as sdsdqui064g with adapter and sdsdqua064g without adapter this conflicts with product description on amazon while this is likely just amazon not getting product description right again a bit too common thing it is interesting to noteupdate apr 20 2013some numbers from testing the card the test is extremely simple write out 1gb of zeros onto the card using standard unix dd command to read 128kb blocks of zeroes from special device devzero and write it onto the card 128kb 8192 1gb dd displays transfer stats once it finishes while dd was running i run iostat in second terminal displaying 1 second interval stats as a measure of current speed this was done on the mac dd command line can be used asis to repeat test on linux system however iostat command is different on linux and would need to be modified slightly i choose 128kb block size as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow using different block sizes results are comparable dd ifdevzero oftest bs131072 count819281920 records in81920 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 101578307 secs 10570582 bytessecso 10 mbs and all is good right wrong iostat running in parallel with above dd command recorded this iostat d w 1 disk2disk2kbt tps mbs12311 76 91211661 185 210412294 49 58812800 41 51212800 89 12800 134 167312800 69 86112800 61 76212800 99 1236 and so on until dd finishes writing 1gb of zeros to the card in my opinion the last column should never dip under 10mbs for card labeled class10for comparison same test run against samsung pro 64gb microsd card dd ifdevzero oftest bs131072 count819281920 records in81920 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 528691 secs 20309436 bytessec iostat d w 1 disk2disk2kbt tps mbs12530 138 168611773 157 180312304 150 180012800 159 198612800 156 194712645 160 197312800 150 187212800 154 192212800 153 1911 and so on until dd finishes writing 1gb of zeros to the card so samsung is on average 2x faster but more importantly it is speed is much more constant and critically important it never dips under 10mbs,2.0

excellentworks perfectly and for a fair price it is immediately recognized by any device you use it good purchase,5.0
awesome and works just fineneeds little to no formatting and i have yet to see a sandisk fail do not cut corners almost every other brand of sd cards will fail on you except these tried numerous brands with my devicesjust remember it takes a bit for devices to buffer the information off of the sd card and static can corrupt any sd card which is usually easily fixed with a formatting always back up your documents to a pcmac as soon as possibleoh and if you create playlists slideshows and so on on devices and remove the sd card the device will not be smart enough to recompile it after you put the sd card back in and you will end up with blank playlists even though you have the songs so watch outlastly if this sd card does not work for you for whatever reason google sd card formatting and it should help you out these 64gb versions do not seem to have formatting issues like the 32gb ones do but even then formatting to fat32 fixes it,5.0

works on the raspberry pi and seems to be genuinei use this for a raspberry pi in the sd adapter and it works so faralso appeared to be the genuine part although the prolific sandisk counterfeiters have gotten really sneaky in recent yearsi like getting microsdhc cards because they can be adapted to different device sizes for example let us say i buy a used phone or ereader that needs a memory card and i am not using my pi i can just take the pis card take it out of the adapter and put it in the other device rather than pay more money and wait a week for delivery of a new one,4.0

good micro sd can only be formatted in exfatthis micro sd card is perfect for any smartphone user looking to expand the storage on their device i personally am using one in my samsung galaxy note 3 works like a charm it is adequately fast cheap and fairly reliable if you are looking for extremely fast speeds however you should consider the sandisk extreme series which are the fastest microsd cards in the world my card came with an adapter that this card plugs into and it becomes a full sized sd card if you are looking to use this in a camera or any other device that uses sd cards please look elsewhere these cards are not nearly as fast as the full sized sd cards used in cameras the adapter should only be used for transporting data from the phone or other device to a computer all in all these are a great buy for any smartphone user looking for a higher storage capacity the price fluctuates often so catch em while there cheep i got mine for around 30,4.0
less than a year and the card has failed mei bought this on august of 2013 as of april 2014 the card stopped functioning it can still be read but the writing capability is gone that is less than one year i am extremely disappointed in the longevity of this card my usage of it has been on my galaxy s4 i have about 40gb of data in it guess i am going to have to look for another card that has a longer lifespan than this one,1.0

never again sandiskhaving used sandisk before in my photography i of course went to them when it was time to outfit my new samsung galaxy s3 with an internal microsd card i spent the extra bucks over comparably no name micro sd cards and bought this variant i took quite a few pictures and even transferred an album from my computer so i coud show it to friends on the goafter less than two months the sandisk microsd card started acting up it was not recognized stopped restarted removed itself reinstalled itself onto the phone erratic behavior here is where i should have taken it out immediately and tried to recover anything i could before things hit the fanunfortunately i waited too long and this morning for no other reason than i turned my phone on the card shows up as blank neither my windows pc nor my mac can even detect the card and yes i tried two different adapters and i tried the sandisk recovery which found no recoverable files even though i checked all file type extensionsi have apparently lost all the pictures i had on there to top it all off my gfs cheap no name card has never had an issue in her exact same phone and keeps chugging along merrilypaying a premium for a substandard product that fails in use after two months no thanks i am going back to lexar which has not failed me yet i am also getting rid of all my sandisk cards for my dslrs just in case the fact that sandisk is the first card thats ever failed on me and a new card to boot does not inspire confidence buy and use at your own risk,1.0

okinitially when i inserted the card into the samsung galaxy s3 it recognized it but it was not able to format it correctly after doing some research i found a free program easeus partition master that will format the card into fat 32 since windows no longer allows you to do it by default after formatting it into fat 32 the phone recognized the card and it works great now i hope this helps anyone else that might run into this problem,4.0
requires special formattingin some situations depending on what hardware you intend to use this card in youll need to format it in a special way using a formatting utility that does not come native to windows also the card gets extremely hot under heavy load,4.0
nice memory upgradeinstalled this in my droid bionici just backed up all my data using the included card reader adapter and the card reader slot on the laptop and copied all data to a folder on my pc once done reversed the process to my new micro sd cardbionic recognized additional memory some applications had to run updates after adding card though this i do not attribute to the card itself it seems likely the applications were referencing something specific with hardware maybeafter the updates programs ran as expectedi did have one issue with poweramp media player where all the playlists dissapeared not sure why and havent yet researched this in the poweramp forums i assume this same issue would occur with any card upgrade,5.0
dependable dependable dependablein the past i have bought lots of compare and sd cards and usb keys years ago i bought brands randomly until i had a failure with a particularly highpriced brand at the time these critters were tres chere so i decided to standardize on wd because i would never had a failure except for hard drives but that is a different topicnow that the price per gig is less than i used to pay per meg i still stick with wd because i am using these cards over long periods of time and do not want to lose the datai recognize that this is anecdotal and may or may not be in line with what consumer reports says or others experience but by now i am a mindless fan and frequently chant roll widenow if only they would get rid of the antishoplifting packaging,5.0

love the capacityi have had this card for some time now and i have only had one problem with it and i believe that problem to be with my phone the cards formatting became corrupted and while i could still copy to and from using my computer my phone did not recognize the card copying the data off formatting the card and copying the data back onto it fixed the issue it is really nice to have 64gbs of extra data storage on my phone,5.0
have had no issues with this micro sd cardive purchased this microsd card back in january for use in my tablet and my android smartphone i have used this card extensively to transfer music and files and i have found it is rather interchangeable and versatile across a number of surfaces the card has not corrupted itself or become unusable at any point so i figure for the value that is pretty much what i want and 32 gb covers the amount of storage i would want for my mobile devices,5.0
great mixro sdxc card for the samsung s3ive used this card for about 3 months now and have not had a bit of trouble i notice to delay while the phone writes to the memory after taking pictures or shooting full hd video,5.0
reliable expansion for your microsdxc needsi was not absolutely certain if this would work in my samsung galaxy si an sghi747m from a regional carrier here in alaskai read several reviews but took a chance the 64gb card would work in my device and was pleased when it arrivedopting for the frustration free package it was a very simple matter to open the little cardboard envelop to retrieve the contents a side note here i do appreciate the amazon packaging for items such as this where a clamshell type of container adds no valuethe card is well made and seems a quality product installed the card and it was recognized instantly on boot the full capacitywas recognizedmaybe i am old school when it comes to memory cards but i always format them in the device i intend on using them at least initially in this case there were no issueswhile i have not scientifically measured read write speeds of the card performance is respectable i have suffered no issuesrelated to the operation of the cardi would highly recommend this product if you are looking for this capacity and your device will accept the microsdxc format to that end several friends have purchased and been satisfied with this memory card in their devices,5.0
decent price for storage space but not nearly fast enoughi will keep it short and sweet for potential buyers looking for facts and not bsi own two of the 32gb size of these cards for about 3 months now they do work fairly well with cell phones and tablets yet not so good with cameras in fact these cards failed to work with my gopro hero3 camera and the customer service rep from gopro claimed and i happen to agree with him that this card is not a true class 10 card let alone uhs1benchmarks with my evo 4g with all allocation sizes the write speed never passed beyond 8mbs while read speeds wondered around 25mbs far below advertised speeds well write speeds arent technically advertised probably because they are of class 4 levelbenchmarks with crystal mark reported speeds even lower due to adapter with write speeds around 6mbs while read speeds wondered around 20mbsneedless to say if you are not worried about speeds and only about storage these are perfect if you want to use them for shooting high definition raw footage however i suggest you not to loose your money on this because even if your write speeds are around 10mbs as the card begins to decay it will slow down to become uselessagain this review is based on gopro camera and high definition raw recording for cell phones or for storage it works perfectly well with a bit of false advertisement,3.0
five starsjust what i needed for my digital music collection on my phone,5.0
memoriesmemory either works or not what more can be said than it works as designed i was very happy with the price,5.0
use it in my samsung tabletmore than a year in and still going strong it boosts the memory of the tablet so i can store movies for trips and the tablet stores big files there automatically to save it is own brain for more important things,5.0
perfectno complaints worked in every piece of electronics i have tried them in i have run across fake chips online before but these are high quality at a good price,5.0
good price for the speednot as fast as advertised most of the time actually slowed down my note 3 when i filled it with movies leaving only about 8gb free switched to a faster card due to that but it could also be the phones fault all in all it is a good card with good speed and size for the money,4.0
the best there isproduct supplied as described 16gb micro sdhc class 10 card with adapter i purchased this to use in my samsung galaxy tablet and it works perfectly it is easy to identify from other micro flash cards you may have because of its redgrey color this is a great memory solution for your stored media for any device,5.0
installed in my htc thunderbolt works fineproduct works as advertised no issues with install or general use in my mobile phone it does not seem particularly snappy but that may be more the phone than anything else,4.0
fast quick easy tiny as all get outquick little puppy sandisk makes nice quality stuff with one exceptionthe adapter that came with it to let it work in the bigger slot failed horribly after 4 daysadapters pshbut my transformer likes it treats it like a child and it fits very snugly into the latching system a recent store bought one wiggles,4.0

just the thing i needed for my note 3simply put the card works well in my note 3 gives me the extra space needed and to date has worked flawlessly i upgraded from a 64gb sandisk to the 128gb with no issues plenty of space available now in my phone and i can keep movies and music local some people have scoffed online about using such a large card but the reality of it is that you do not always have data service and when that time comes such as when youre on a plane its nice to have access to some movies and music that youve kept on local storageso far its worked in my note 3 and sg4,5.0
all of the spaceso i am not going to pretend to be an expert on sd cards but i still like this one it is relatively inexpensive works wonderfully for the movies i want to store and watch on my samsung galaxy tab 7 20 and i have not had a single problem with storage yet,5.0

good cardthe card arrived promptly and has worked flawlessly in a dashcam would recommend purchase to others if they need this kind of card,5.0
looks good the package is horrible thoughthe card looks good works fine i did not do too much test with itmy only complaint until now is the package there is a line marked on the back for you to cut i cut along the line and nothing happened no opening at all all cardboard glued tightly so i cut near the card only to found i cut the supposed plastic card casestorage shell now i took it out and no storage case to store not a functional problem but annoying,4.0
almostthe package arrived on time it is very well packed and it is got an adapter it works perfectly with my phone though it does not allow a computer format once it is been on the phone so it asks you to erase everything before you use it on a computer so if youre planning on buying this for different purposes and devices gotta be aware of this i just need for my phone so i transfer files with my usb cable that works just right i also give it a 3 star because it says there are 64gb but even when it is totally formatted it only reaches to 60gbso i do not know where my other 4 gb areanyways overall it is working well i do think it is expensive for what it is,3.0
whats there to say about an sd cardthere really is not much to say about a micro sd card it either works or it does not i bought this to install in my phone and it seems to be working fine the fit was perfect and the performance is totally satisfactory i have never had any trouble with sandisk products and this will likely be no exception it was a great value compared to places i had priced locally,5.0

good sd cardthis is a great sd card it is very fast and works well i have been using it for my gopro with no complaints,5.0
fastthis is a very fast microsd card compared to the class 4 speeds it looks nice and it works i am not sure what else i can say other than that i have no problems with it and it has not died on my yetit is been about 4 months at least now in my samsung galaxy s3 the s3 had a reputation for breaking sandisk sd cards for some reason and it is only randomly unmounted about 3 times but easily remounted with a take out and put back in with maybe a restart on the phone to refresh some applications to see it i think this is just because the galaxy s3 tends to get really hot right below the sd card which might damage it a bit i do not think they put it in a good spot but that has nothing to do with the card itself so just get it if you want a nice sd card,5.0
brilliant price beats iphones 200 price for 64gb phone by 150this is the best accessory that you can buy for your smartphone simple explanation1 i loaded all my hd movies onto this micro sd card inserted it into my samsung galaxy s3 and it plays them superbly without any delays as it it up to 30mbs read speed2 the most important reason for this being the best accessory for your phone is to think about this the premium you pay for an iphone 64gb is 200 the price you pay for this 64gb micro sd card is 50 depends on amazons pricing at the time that means you get the same thing for 150 less and you can interchange your sd card between devices if you buy a new tablet for exampleno brainernote that it reads only at 10mbs so a 7gb hd movie will take about 10 15 minutes to load up,5.0

warning read thisif your card gets hot enough to be painful it is defective and you need to contact sandiskfrom my experience the larger micro sds run hot on format and writing but not to the pain thresholdi purchased one of these cards to use in a camera and android tablet great read speed but write speed was okay used card for about two weeks and then all my files disappeared tried to format the card and three different computers with xp windows and linux could not format it the camera and tablet could not format it i rmad it and got another because sandisk is a good brand i did notice that when formatting or writing the card it got hot very hotsecond card did not last 24 hours and had the exact same symptoms as the first card write a file or format it resulted in the card getting hot enough to reach the pain threshold i called up sandisk and while explaining this was the second card i would received with the exact same symptoms when i mentioned it getting hot they immediately issued me an rma they said they were told to issue an rma the moment they heard a card ran hotsmaller sandisk micro sds or regular sds i have or use do not do this i think sandisk has an issue with this cardthe last 4 digits of the part number refer to the date code and origin of the card both cards had different date and origin codes,1.0

junkdoes not work i have a card purchased at best buy that looks identical side by side but transferring music onto the best buy purchased card was extremely fast 100 meg albums transferred in 2 to 3 seconds on these cards a 61 meg album was at 18 minutes remaining with less than a quarter of the album transferred i bought two so i figured maybe a bad card tried the other same thing extremely slow wonder if they are even real,1.0
this works very well in my samsung galaxy note 2my pour note 2 has been working absolutely overtime i just love it so much so i am downloading a great many pictures audible books and of mp3s from amazon with all of these many interest of mine working over time i soon found that the 32 gb microcard was just too small so when amazon had a great sale on the 64 gb ones i purchased it my main concerns was would it work in my phone and be fast enough to do so seamlessly well that it was this 64 gb microsdxc class 10 did so whatever sandisk wants to name it the bottom line is that it works seamlessly and now i do not get those nasty warnings telling me my memory was almost full it is very nice that samsung realized the need to be able to use such larger memory cards and the note 2 allows this size card use without any issues at all,5.0

once properly formatted the card reads and writes effectively does very well for playing highdefinition video contentbe awareif you want to use this device to record and play highdefinition video with files greater than 4gb youll need to format the card as exfat or ntfs if you want to play the files on either a pc or a mac but it works well after properly formatting,4.0
not recommended for the galaxy s3i think this is probably a fine product but it was not compatible with my samsung galaxy s3 phone formatted as exfat as it came from the factory did not work at all but that is a known problem with the gs3 but even after reformatting to fat32 the card caused my phone to reboot multiple times,3.0

probably could have scrimpted and paid lessi just bought two of these for our two new samsung galaxy iv smart phones the adapters will make it possible for the card readers on our computers to accept these microsd cards if we find it worthwhile to pull them out of the phone case rather than use the usb dongle to move information on and off the phones but most importantly now i do not worry about storing audio books favorite playlists and video clips i might want to show someone on the phones,4.0

slow transferi do not get the advertised speed of 30mbs more like a 200300kbs on my galaxy s4 at least it gives me a lot of extra storage space for a phone it works nicely if you do not need to transfer big files,3.0
sandisk is always worth the moneyi originally bought a samsung equivalent and then my phone was stolen so i made the switch i have done some research and realized the class 10 and the sdxc are very important as it is the quickest rate of transfer however when you read samsungs description and this one samsung claims 80 mbps and sandisk has 30 mbps after using both they are identical the class and the sdxc are the most important they are almost absolutely identical samsungs equivalent is 65 and this was under 50 i have not noticed a bit of difference besides that maybe this mircosd card is a bit quicker and easier to move files around i store a lot on my phone which is a samsung note 3 this works beautifully,5.0

32 gb postage stampit is so hard to imagine that you can have 32 gb is something smaller than a postage stamp yet here it isi bought this card to work with my call of duty ghosts tactical camera and it works perfectly the camera came with a 4 g card which i filled in just over an hour at the local kart track i missed the last bit of our race due to insufficient capacity the battery was still going strong so i needed more card for recording my adventuresthis card fits the bill nicelyas a uhs speed class 1 roughly equiv class 10 card this sd card is quite capable of any photographic or video need up to full hd not 2k or 4k i use a similar card in my canon 60d and am able to hold around 700 raw images and a few hours of hd videohere are some benchmarks for comparison including this cardmacbook pro retina ssd430 mbs write323 mbs readgeneric class 6 4gb came with ghost camera98 mbs write21 mbs readsandisk extreme class 10 8gb21 mbs write23 mbs readthis card san disk ultra uhc 112 mbs write45 mbs readwhat does this mean it means that you should have no trouble recording hd video reliably with this card your camera will be able to save pictures quickly to this card so it is ready to take the next shot if you fill the card completely it will take roughly 12 minutes to copy all the data off of the card assuming the device you are copying to can keep upthe tests were done in the built in sd card drive of the macbook pro using the included sd card adapterbased on my tests i would say that if you do not really need a micro sd then you should buy a standard sd card your performance might be better and the price should be lower however if you think you need or might need a micro sd down the road this is a suitable solution,5.0

sandisk micro class 10 cardi bought a class 10 samsung and returned it after i found out the speed was actually lower than that class after buying and using many different brands i have found that this company makes the fastest highest quality memory cards other companies advertise their cards as being certain classes but they are not up to par i think 19 is a steal best buy sells this product for 39 as of 712the card i recieved must have been a dud it is broken and my phones are not able to read it when i try to use it in the computer it says the card is damaged i will be returning to amazon,5.0
best buy in terms of price speed space for sandisk not been able to compare with other brands yet thoughworks as specified received in good condition from amazon using since a few months in a smartphone it does not get better than this if youre using sandisk in terms of speed and space you can expect speeds upto 28 mbsec for write about 30mbsec for read with the provided adapter speeds ar always better for both readwrite using smartphone to readwrite speeds would be lesser mostly but average should be 20mbsec anyways as per what i have seen and i am a heavy user like if there is a 256gb microsdxc available i would actually buy it tried the extreme version with 80mbsec costs 2 times of this one but works similar to this so dont waste money on name that doesnt deliver buy this if youre buying to sandisk,5.0

works as advetised somewhat lower capasitythan i expected i do not know if it would kill any manufacturers to actually have a memory card or stick or device to actually have available the advertised capacity fortunately l learned that the advertised and actual available memory are two separate things before i bought it always scroll down and read the technical spec of a device or anything before you buy as that way ideally your actually informed let the buyer beware is more appropriate every day as most things are not exactly as they seem and if it is food and cheap it is likely cancer causing and do not feed your body and your car in the same place,3.0

great product but watch out for postage scalpersi have noticed something very crooked onlinepostage scalpers charging 8 bucks to mail out micro sd cards that usually come in a small envelope i mean come on the feet needs to crack down on these postage scalpers because they are working in full force these daysi would say a microsd card should mail no higher than a 150 to 300 bucks but 800sthese crooks are demented i have just been deleting orders out of my cart will keep doing so till i find one that would not rip me offgreat products come from scan disk but buyers beware of these shops who mark these things with high priced postage then mail it out in a small envelope and yes almost everyone i have ever ordered came in a small envelope by the wayshame on you i think i will write my congressman about it for whatever good thatll do witha 10 rating as they never care what we the people wantnever the less you all should be fined by the feet for committing highway robbery end of review hopes this helps others speak out against highway robbery via high postage gauging as said above i will keep browsing till i find a good store who would not commit this crime as my dad likes to say there is no honest people anymoreone final note amazon all of the other online outlets should stop allowing people to charge what they want for postage only allow them to ship it at cost aka price figuring via what the item actually ships for at the pofedx or ups,5.0

make sure to check the batch date after march 2013my original two cards were manufactured in 2012 and over time started affecting the functionality of our phones some internet research resulted in reading another review on amazon with similar problems and discussed to contact sandisk support for replacements due to a known silicon bug the new cards arrived in about a week and we returned the old cards with the defects only hassle was was trying to read the serial and date codes off of the car but a phone with 4x zoom made it possible sandisk customer support was easy to work with and the products new and old are fast and worked great,5.0

did not work in surface pro did not try it in another devicei bought this primarily to use in my surface pro it would randomly dismount itself i do not know if it was the surfaces fault or the cards fault upon doing a little internet searching i found this to be a common problem with sandisk cards and the surface pro i used another brand microsdxc and it has worked fine,3.0
unwriteable after 10 monthsthis card was used in a phone without a large amount of write stress which does shorten the life of the card it was not written to over and over in the phonethe card is now totally unwriteable on a mac a linux machine or the phone writes all seem to succeed but even lowlevel reformats do not actually do anything the exact same files are there after every change untouchable and frozen forever10 months of use out of a memory card and then a really weird failure like this neither the mac linux machine or phone reports any error is not acceptable quality from sandisk,1.0
all these positive reviews cannot be wrongand they are rightthis microsdhc card is fast i started formatting it a little behind another class 10 card not a uhs1 card and it formatted all 32gb ahead of the transcend 16gb card which is no slouch either it is the fastest flash card i have sent yet i doubt you will be disappointed unless youre an alien with more advanced technology,5.0

big storage with nice performance64gb for this price is a nice deal especially when you are trying to add storage capability for a tablet or phone keep in mind that not all phonestabletsdevices support 64gb so you may have to get the 32 gb instead performance is very good especially when weighing with price and capacity,5.0
the goto microsd memory card for video devicesi own several video recording devices surveillance carbased dvr systems and so on and the sandisk class 10 cards always use class 10 cards when dealing with hd video are the only ones which survive these extreme environmentsi have been using sandisk for years and while i do admit to trying other great brands once in a while i always come back to sandisk and will stick with itmany non sandisk brand cards might advertise class 10 as well but do not achieve the same writing speeds in fact cheaping out on these cards may result in your video recording devices to become unstable or worse corrupt datahighly recommended,5.0
already dead in less than a yeari have had this for 8 months and the sd card already stopped deleting files and keeping pictures i have tried reformatting and nothing helps not coolupdate april 2 2014 i contacted sandisk and i am sending the problematic card back for warranty replacement i hope this will resolve the issue with the card i will keep you updated once the process is complete,1.0

bought for samsung galaxy s4we have bought two of these you get an open slot with your smartphone and you should use it pictures movies and music will fill up your primary device storage in a heartbeat further it is a good practice to have your personal stuff like the things i just mentioned saved to an external drive so as to not be in the mix should the horrific happen and you have to get your phone wipedword to the wise encrypt your storage both primary device and external sd for the samsung galaxy s4 at least that in turn requires that you use a phone unlock code of at least six characters with at least one of them being nonnumeric i know this can appear to be a pain in the butt but the first time your device is ganked and you are not panicking because your stuff is encrypted youll thank me nekkid pictures are not the only things of concern mind you an unencrypted device stolen by the wrong hands is not just 25 in crack cocaine moneyit is much much more than that in terms of lucrative identity theft opportunities do not be that guy encrypt your phone there are walkthroughs showing how to do that for whatever device you happen to have on youtube i am certain,5.0

not one but two failuresbought 2 of these for the wifes my android phone when hers failed after 2 months we figured it was just luck of the draw now mine failed after just over 4 months losing a bunch of photos videos i made sure to back up every few weeks but even so we just lost a bunch of photos of our 2 month newbornclearly sandisk had a bad batch with this lot and as the return policy is horrible i would not be buying any more sandisk no matter how cheap when we bought them on sale around january 2013 they were over half the price of similar sd cards again sandisk clearly knew they had a bad batch shame on them for dumping them on the customer no matter how cheapwhile i would presumed they would have solved the problem in production buy at your own risk sandisk will sell product with ridiculous failure rateedit after submitting my review i did some more research on other sites and the low star reviews here sandisk is so clearly guilty of selling a defective product from the batch about 6 months ago which as i said before is when they put them on a super discount sale they knew what they were doing and they are thumbing their nose at customers who just fell outside warrantee like myselfto knowingly sell your customer something that is going to fail at an unacceptable rate and then ignore them because it failed a little bit outside warrantee is just bad faith i beg people considering buying this product to not do so and thumb up the reviews warning of failures it is only when companies lose sales do they reconsider not screwing their customers like thispersonally i have bought several sandisk thumb drives compactflash cards and a sandisk mp3 player the thumb drives were ok but i wouldnt buy another mp3 player from them it was buggy as hell up until now i had an overall neutral to favorable opinion of them not anymoreif you think i am overreacting please just skim through a few pages submitted in springtime of 2013 there is at least one or more 6 months and it failed reviews per page,1.0

galaxy note 2to begin i am not that knowledgeable in tech matters so when i received a new galaxy note 2 as a gift and decided to add storage i read some reviews on the sd cards and was reading about the compatibility of the 64 gb cards exfat or fat i guess the exfat was a successful diet i was concerned somewhat but i ordered this one anyway and this is what my experience was i added some music and videos onto the card using my apple macbook air with no problems and then inserted it into the note 2 with no problems and it immediately loaded everything with no problems i have since taken it out and added some more music to it and it is working perfectly i did not reformat or anything like that which was a great relief although i have only used this item for a week now with issue which means something could go wrong in the future i would give it more than 5 stars if possible because it was easy for someone like me i know i used the phrase no problems multiple times but when you are my age and things go smoothly with no problems it is very good,5.0

decent card but does not meet speed specificationsthe product is ok but my card does not acheive the rated write speed of 10 mbsec most applications probably do not need to hit 10 mbsec but my gopro hero 3 does need the full bandwidth and thus would bomb on me sometimes as tested my card got between 810 mbsec using the larger block sizes i complained to sandisk about it and they allowed me to send it in for a replacement which i did and took almost 2 weeks but the replacement behaved the same way i would say this card is ok for most applications but if you need top end speed i would go with another card i bought my card in may 2013 and had it replaced in august 2013 so hopefully they have fixed this problem by now,2.0
just what i neededpay attention to your application and what class your card is class 4 or unclassed may be cheaper but it may not give you the performance you want do not be pennywise and poundfoolish this was purchased to go into one of the newer mk808 version tv streamer dongles and those take class 10 for the price this was a good valuei have been using sandisk xd and sd regular and micro for 8 years now and always found them to be a consistent and high grade storage card i can recommend this brand,5.0
good producti bought a couple of these to use with a gopro hero camera since i have never had bad luck with a sandisk product i chose this to store my precious photos and videos on a class 10 device it can not only store average video photos and sound but is fast enough the handle the 3 shot per half second rate the cameras multishot mode demands,5.0
defective after 9 months lost pics and videolosing pictures video and tunes after 9 months on a samsung galaxy note 2 stock android looks like this is a common problem i will try my luck with sandisk on monday if i do not get a replacement i will never buy a sandisk product again i paid the premium for sandisk quality i am very disappointedupdatesandisk will be providing a replacement sd card however my data loss and downtime cannot be replaced sandisk lost their premium rating in my eyes it is going to take a while for them to get it back,1.0

no brainerthese things hardly go wrong last forever the bigger the betterwith sandisks longstanding reputation at the right price point preferably at least 075 per gb or lower priices can only continue to drop as technology improvesnot much to think about really if you need the space at this price youve hit a sweet spot for the momentgreat thing about micro sd cards is their versatility you can stick it in your camera then stick it in your phone to review share tge speed of these cards pricecapacity used to be a problem no longer now just watch the price of 64 gb cards as the next level of resistanceorder was delivered on time price was right it is humming away reliably in my phone at the moment what not to like,5.0

did not work for mei bought this to use as expanded storage in my asus transformer book t100 but it was unstable and i have had to return it although the tablet would see the card when it was first inserted there would be errors trying to copy files onto it and then windows would indicate that it needed formatting if i tried a quick format then everything seemed to be ok but the instability would return as soon as i tried to copy data to the card if i tried a full format it always failedi gave it two starts because it seemed to work using the supplied sd adapter in a windows 7 laptop i was able to do a full format on that but when i put it back into the tablet the problems continued the tablet is compatible with sdxc cards and when i tried a different micro sd card in the tablet it worked fine so i assume it was a problem with this card,2.0
not good enough for gopro cameragood card at a good price but i bought it specifically for my gopro camera even though its a class 10 its not fast enough to record on the higher quality settings i guess not all class 10 are the same even among the exact same cards you will need to buy the extreme version for gopro,4.0
simply an outstanding microsdi purchased this to expand the internal memory of my smart phone specifically the galaxy s3 it performs absolutely flawlessly if you have any reservations about this micrsddo not there is no need to format since it comes pre formatted should you desire to format do it from within the phones settings and again no issues please turn the phone off and remove the battery before installationlaughing out loud,5.0

good value for a fast microsdno complaints about this card it is much faster than what came with my android devices and of course the capacity is nice i have not experienced any issues indicating any defect,5.0
good value for memory could be fasteri bought this to go along with my new s4 that i purchased and i have to say i am pleasantly surprised at how much 32gb can get you on a phone i have pushed all of my applications to my sd card which has given me plenty of free room on my phone a major detraction placed on the s4 especially i do notice that since moving most of my applications to the card some load times and other features may take an extra second to really get going this may lead me towards going with more powerful sd cards in the future though i am assured this will work for all of my current needs,4.0

great memory card for galaxy s3works great in my verizon samsung galaxy s3 the only thing i found that did not work was trying to transfer my files using a usb microsd card reader when i used this usb reader it copied my files but the phone did not show them or could not write to the card i had to put the microsdxc card in the phone and copy my files the slow way using the usb cable the card does run hot when copying files to or from it that would be normal i assume with it being class 10 best bang for the buck in my opinion i would buy another one if i needed it,5.0
five starsyes,5.0

it does what it is supposed tothe sandisk ultra 64 gb is just a storage device so i do not find that there will be many features to get excited about that being said it is advertised as having 30mbs transfer speed but this is misleading it can read up to 30 mbs however and the packaging says this too it writes at a slower rate i used this for my phone too much music and had the stock 8 gb microsd that came with my phone i had about 65 gb of data that i wanted to transfer back to my new microsd card and this took about 30 minutes if this were a strict transfer from my internal hard drive to an external it would be faster but this is not such a connection it lost a star because the transfer took so long but in reality i do not expect to be transferring 6 gbs of data anytime soon so this problem will be minimal for me other than that it works great and i have not had any issues with the formatting or reading,4.0
it works finei picked this up to slam into my s3 phone it works greatif you are thinking about it for that just order itif you have an s3 64 gig is the largest card it will support,4.0
great micro sd just not for a galaxy s3this does not appear to work with the samsung galaxy s3 it worked for a few weeks then my phone started giving me unexpected unmounted sd card error messages after a bit of searching people seem to agree that the s3 and sandisk micro sd cards do not work together,1.0

compatibility issues very slow write speedthis card would not show 64 gb until i spent 60 on a card reader that supports sdxc and after doing that it is transferring at class 1 speed i managed to get it formatted in fat32 with 59 gb free for my cowon j3 but it is taking 10 hours to transfer 30 gb to it i got a refund because this is not the service and quality i paid for i just hope the music lists on my pmp when i turn it on tomorrow i have it in the microsdxc slot of the aft pro57u which is connected to a syba via vl800 usb 30 card feel free to tell me i am doing it wrong and how to get class 10 speedupdate the transfer finished but the data does not show in my cowon j3 so the early versions that worked are gone do not buy these for a device that is not sdxc specific because they have changed something in them,2.0
great sd cardi purchased this card for my parents asus transformer tablet as a christmas gift it installed with no issues and they love it i made the mistake of buying a no name sd card for my tablet motorola xoom previously and had to return it as my tablet did not recognize it the sandisk brand is excellent quality i guess it just goes to show you you get what you pay for the amazon price is good never again will buy cheap for a memory card,5.0

why spend 200 for extra memory apple will not let you use thesenot going to go on a rant about apple but sure glad other phones allow these tiny slots that quadruples the memory i drop and dragged tons of my music to the sd card and android just finds it automatically and adds it to your list of music,5.0
performance is as advertised barely test includedthe description on the amazon page calls this a class 10 card with uhs1 performance and while technically correct full hd 1080p recording you would expect more performance in the sequential write speeds it actually does not even hit the class 10 speed unless you round up 9951 mbs i have 2 of these cards and they both report the same speed my kingston 8gb sdhc class 4 writes at 11854 mbs now keep in mind the sandisk beats the other cards in the random reads and writes so maybe the design for those faster random reads and writes causes the sequential writes to run slower than expected here is the test for the san disk followed by the kingstoncrystaldiskmark 302 c 20072013 hiyohiyocrystal dew world sandisk ultra 16gb class 10 micro sdhc uhs i speed mbs 10 bytes sata300 30 bytessequential read 20651 mbssequential write 9951 mbsrandom read 512kb 20191 mbsrandom write 512kb 2628 mbsrandom read 4kb qd1 3656 mbs 8925 iopsrandom write 4kb qd1 1665 mbs 4064 iopsrandom read 4kb qd32 3293 mbs 8039 iopsrandom write 4kb qd32 1618 mbs 3950 iopstest 10 mb f 00 00148 gb x1date 20130326 212809os windows 7 home premium edition sp1 61 build 7601 x64crystaldiskmark 302 x64 c 20072013 hiyohiyocrystal dew world kingston 8gb sdhc class 4 mbs 10 bytes sata300 30 bytessequential read 20287 mbssequential write 11854 mbsrandom read 512kb 19925 mbsrandom write 512kb 1728 mbsrandom read 4kb qd1 3747 mbs 9147 iopsrandom write 4kb qd1 0017 mbs 42 iopsrandom read 4kb qd32 3684 mbs 8995 iopsrandom write 4kb qd32 0017 mbs 43 iopstest 10 mb f 533 4047875920 mb x1date 20130327 104856os windows 7 home premium edition sp1 61 build 7601 x64,4.0

bought for galaxy s4i bought this memory card the day i received my samsung galaxy s4 it arrived in two days via prime plugged it in and formatted it offers 5945 gbs of usable space being that the card is class 10 reads are super fast and writes are great uhs1 is sadly mostly only supported by dslrs so most smartphones and devices would not take advantage of the super super speed but nonetheless the card is fastthis card has lots of storage affordable transfers and reads fast i would recommend this for people who carry a lot of media such as music and videos,5.0
no problemsi got this for my gopro hero3 and so far its working great the gopros really eat up the flash memory so i bought 3 of the 32 gb models i suggest that unless you are going on a particularly long scuba dive or adventure you should get the 32 gb over the 64 gb cards as it spreads out the risk of any one card failure causing loss of all your videos,5.0

got a lemoni wish i could say this card was great been waiting for it for around a year and a half whilst using the 64gb one also sandisk which never gave me issues sadly i lost it this card confused the heck out of me i used it on my s4 and first off it wouldnt recognize it tried it on my gfs s4 and same problemapparently it comes formatted as exfat and thought maybe reformatting it as fat32 would solve the problem well i thought it did since my phone finally recognized it upon inserting it a new problem arose though i started taking pictures to try it out and odd thing was some of the pictures became corrupted not even viewable on the phone seconds after taking them some worked others notlater on i restarted my phone for some reason or other a while later i wanted to check the pictures again and surprise surprise everything was gone i would find out later that every time i restarted my phone everything on the card was being deleted tried it on my gfs phone and same thing happenedtried reformatting again as fat32 using gparted could not hurt and it just throws errors upon starting the write sequencetoo bad i cannot return it as i had it shipped to me in guatemala so that is 119 down the toilet i have to buy a new one now but i think i will go for the new samsung evo ones although they do not offer a 128gb model as of this writing bummer,1.0

fast and flawless under demanding conditionsi bought a bunch of these for many many hours use with hires video cameras and every one has been fast and flawlessplus if you get more than one like me you might want a way to keep track of which is which notice there is a small blank area in the red to the right of the sandisk name you can write a number there with a fine tip marker do not try that on one of those solid black chips,5.0
good card for your galaxie phone or other phone components mine works great wonderful card and performs fast and efficient i use it with my samsung galaxie s3 with no problems love the hjgh caparcity it offers and reliability of sandisk,5.0
samsung galaxy s3 scrambled filesi cannot say if it is the sd card or the phone but google sez it is the phone put your mp3s on this card for your galaxy s3 and the result is a jumble of corrupted files yep that is what i got so in fairness to sandisk i gave this card 4 stars and a suggestion to yall out there get the 16gb card for your s3 instead,4.0
finally one that workspreviously purchased two adata microsd cards one which never worked and one which failed on the second bootso far no problems with tht sansdisk chip,4.0
very nice for the price read for real world reviewthe advertisement calls this card a class 10 card however i was not able to get class 10 speeds with this card sd cards seem to be much faster at readwrite then microsd cards i get about 10mbs write speed when copying a file to my sd card through my phone usb cable i get the same transfer rate when in an adapter these small memory cards seem to be very limited on their write speed also this card did heat up some when transferring to it for a long period of time continuously but not too badjust warm the read speeds seem to cap out at about 18mbs but i did see 25mbs on small files one thing to note and this may be by design for this particular card but this card is super fast when transferring small files but slow at big files so youll see slower write speeds the longer you write to it with larger files whereas smaller files zip along one at a time at that 10mbs i was getting 86mbs when writing a 46gb movie file to this card all in all this is an excellent card and beyond worth the money for what you get i love it for my evo 4g lte and my previous phone the evo 4g the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it did not perform as advertised at 30mbs however if you are thinking of getting this memory card for an android phone and do not want to pay big bucks this is your card stop reading and buy it i am glad i did,4.0
2nd suchthis is an excellent product i have no complaints or issues with the card it is the perfect size for my cameras,5.0
great ideato have both the micro and the adapter in the same package i only had to buy one package to get the items i needed for my smartphone and my digicam i replaced the 2 gig micro in my phone with the 32 gig one then reformatted my 2 gig micro to be used in the adapter for my camera then uploaded photos to my laptop using the adapteri would have given it 5 stars but the adapter stopped working after only 2 months truthfully though i do not know if it is because the product is defective or if i just handled it too much or incorrectly so i feel 4 stars is fair,4.0
product is as describedpurchase this for my gopro hero3 it was absolutely perfect and fair in price i might just purchase another one1,5.0
sandisk ultra 16 gb microsdhc class 10 uhs1 memory card with adapterpurchased this for my phone it was easy to install and format for my phone it arrived on time and packaging was appropriate,5.0
no problemsno issues so far sandisk is a good brand so hopefully it will last and be durable well see recommended,5.0
worked just fine as expectedi bought this for my camera which had a 720p video recording option everything works just fine with the card and its adapter,5.0
okay for nowafter purchasing three of these one for myself and two for gifts to others i read reviews that said they sometimes just quit and it is difficult or impossible to recover data i have only been using my own card for 23 weeks but it has not failed yet32713 after having this in my phone for almost 4 months the phone started chirping every few seconds telling me it was either mounting or unmounting a card the sandisk ultra 32 gb microsdhc class 10 uhs1 memory card apparently just decided to fail thank goodness i only had info for one small application on it and only need to access it about once a week so it is not real critical thanks to amazons 30 day return policy though i will probably just have to eat the cost of this one unfortunately i read the other bad reviews about this product after i had already purchased mine 2 of them but my wifes has not failed yet my advice is to stay clear of this product and maybe sandisk in general,4.0
updated memory on my phonei did not realize what small memory i had on my old phone tmobile my touch 3g slide i mean the thing was so slow and not accepting downloading stuff anymore i figured later than the memory might be small sure it was i looked up for a sandisk memory card on amazon and ordered one was surprised it was much cheaper than i had seen in a store installed it in my phone worked like a champ i can still use my phone for different downloads with that much memory,5.0
much improved performance for galaxy s3 phoneupon inserting my hc 16gb card from a motorola doid x into the galaxy s3 my music would play very chopped and sometimes the files would not work at all this card not only cleared that problem up but allows me to put my whole music collection on the phone no complaints so far does its job,5.0
little card holds a lot of stuffi use this card in my 7 igo global positioning system the global positioning system came with a couple of gb onboard but that was quickly used up by wince 6 and that global positioning system software since this device also plays mp3s i wanted more spacei read the meager documentation that came with the device to see if it could handle a 16gb card i was pretty sure it would handle an 8gb card but one never knows with these everchanging specifications unfortunately the documentation for this device was meager and written in pidgin englishok i will buy it and give it a try at worst i swap out my 8gb card from a different device which hopefully will handle the 16gb cardwell too make a long story short too late for that eh the 16gb card works just fine i put a bunch of my mp3s on the card put it into the device and sure enough it recognizes and plays themso pretty much a done deal for the price for the ease of use for the name brand i recommend this little card,5.0
it just worksstay away from nonamebrand flash memory and get a quality sandisk i have owned dozens of their usb flash drives compactflash sd and microsd cards over the years and they just workas for this particular model i have the 64gb microsd in my galaxy note pro 122 tablet and a 16gb microsd my galaxy note 2 smartphonepopped em in and the devices recognized them no problem i can dragdrop copypaste files from internal storage to the cards without issue on the fly or plugged into my computers i always recommend sandisk to anyone looking to expand their storage capacity,5.0
will never reach the said speedit reaches read speed of about 24mbs and write speed of about 18mbs at optimal situationother than the speed everything is fine i would like to say the color is quite a good thing because microsd could be so small that you put it away for a few seconds it will easily disappear with the bright read and light grey color it is much easier to find because it will not blend into common backgroundalso the quality looks good not like some of the microsd cards this is a unibody design that you cannot tell from appearance that where is the circuits the sd card adapter come with it is in quite good quality tooin summery good design good quality not too satisfying speed it will be a judgement call to say if it worth it or not but to me i can totally go with it,4.0
works like a charm every timeive tried other cards going back to when compact flash cards ruled and every single time i wind up coming back to sandisk why because they would not certify a card at a certain speed unless it can sustain that speed and every single sandisk product i have ever owned has lasted and lasted and lasted i have quit using sandisk products because it just did not make sense to keep using them 256mb and 512mb thumbdrives and flash cards they still work really slowly but they still work fine but what the heck do you use them for but the only times i have ever had a sandisk fail i could trace the failure back to something other than a fault in the sandisk product so i buy sandisk because i always get my moneys worth,5.0
effective storageusing this in a security camera that i have mounted outside it does the job of recording the pictures and video the first one failed and had issues but this second one seems to be working well,4.0

was going great thenafter 3 months would not read at all used all sorts of card readers and computers and internals went completely dead strange for a product from this company but i guess it happens may not happen to you but since it is a high capacity would that mean it is more susceptible to becoming corrupted would not buy again maybe a 16gb,3.0
mine gets 7 mbps writes 20mbps readsfor 20 i cannot complain about those speeds too much i put this little guy into a super mini microsd reader to stick into my truck stereo for mp3 storage i use a usb3 memory card reader to populate the card with music and my truck stereo seems happy with it,4.0

must havebefore purchasing this i had a sandisk 16gb class 2 microsdhc needless to say i did not see the need in purchasing one of these then i began to read how class 10 cards really do process recordings faster and records pictures faster i did not believe it so i put it to the test using it in my samsung galaxy si i installed it and recorded videos took pictures and played music on it i also downloaded pdfs for work and other documents to it in every test it was far faster than any other class and you can tell a difference between the classes to close i would just say do not settle for a lower class because it is cheaper wait for these to go on sale because you know as well as i do that they will and purchase one then there is no reason to get a card in a lower class,5.0

fine until it failedi was given this card in october to add to my new samsung galaxy s3 i was thrilled i copied a ton of music onto the card and used my phone as my mobile ipod substitute leaving my ipod classic on my desktop in its speaker system cradleeverything worked fine until a couple of weeks ago i started getting messages that seemed to say that i had removed and inserted the memory card of course i had not touched it then a few days ago the phone told me that the card contained unsupported files and that i needed to reformat it well i tried reformatting after that nothing nothing at all i pulled the memory card reset the phone reinserted the card nothing i tried the card in the adapter on 3 computers it was not even visiblei called sandisk tech support it did not take terribly long to convince them that i had a problem but they quickly offered me two 16 gb cards as a replacement i literally laughed at them i got the disturbing sense that this is something that they are required to try if so that is a lousy business practice after bouncing me around a few time they agreed to send me an rma and a shipping label i duly sent the card off a couple of days ago to be frank i have no idea at all when i might receive a replacementif i werent already in the grips of sandisk i would buy another card the fact that 10 of the comments here are negative is an indication of a real quality control problem a 10 fail rate is simply unacceptable for a product such as thisupdate well i do have to give sandisk credit for customer support i returned the card using the supplied ups label on a tuesday and i received a replacement by ups on the following monday that is very good service it does however increase my suspicion about the offer of two 16 gb because the 32 gb cards were out of stock if they were out of stock they sure got in stock in a big hurry in any event i have upped my rating to two stars,2.0

cheap card to extend the storage for many devices phones tablets surface pro 3 gopro and so onthis card is pretty cheap for how tiny physically and large digitally it is at least in mid 2014 i got it to extend the storage capacity of my surface pro 3 and it has done just that i can store files on it so that i do not have to take up precious space that can be dedicated towards programs since the surface pro 3 has a full windows 8 on it it also doubles as a storage device for my gopro hero 3 black but i have a faster card for it to prevent the freezing issue the size of this micro sd card just does a great job in storing data like videos photos and music it fits in most devices that are moving to micro sdxc such as phones tablets and my beloved surface pro 3 i highly recommend this card if you just need to extend the storage of your device reconsider a faster card if you want to record video straight to it like with a gopro,5.0

slower than sandisk full size sdhc card all the same specsi was working with a three of these cards using the included adapter and thought they were slower than they should be i just bought a full size sandisk ultra 16gb class 10 all the same specs except size theoretically for a different project and it writes over twice as fast on the same computer the write speed on this card is between 7 and 10 mbs the read seems to be 35mbs compared to the full size card with write speed of 22 to 25mbs and a read speed of 42mbs this is from an imaging program not a benchmark program so it is not checking different sizes of transfer and the like compare that with a transcend 4 gb class 4 card the write speed is nearly identical 7 to 9mbs while the read speed on the class four is 12 to 13mbs significantly slower as expectedthe read speed is good but the write speed is abysmal if it says class 10 it should be somewhat close to the class 10 speci am returning them,2.0

really fasti use this memory card in a lenovo thinkpad twist it uses a pcie realtek memory card reader which i fine tuned by bypassing lenovos drivers and use the latest reference ones from realtek directlyin short i care about bottlenecks that things like a usb card reader addsi run applications and thousands of files from this card streaming atop bitlocker to go in windows 8 already i have poured multiples of the 32 gb capacity in reads and writes to this fingernailsized drive and it has kept goingan unbelievable deal as i am normally pretty cheap on these things but i am glad i was able to get the best for cheap for once,5.0
a fully functional memory cardthis card has performed flawlessly so far no read or write errors or speed problems not much more to say but i had to fill up the amazon word count,5.0
have not used it a whole tonthis has really just been used to store some extra files and pass between computers it came with the converter to change it to a standard sd card no issues with either it always amazes me how so much data can be stored in such a small space anyway it will get more use in the next month i am planning on upgrading phones and will knock it down a star if it seems to slow to record video to so if you just see 5 stars it means i am lazy and the disk is still good,5.0

fast class 10 card for your phonei purchased this to put into my samsung galaxy blaze mainly to store music i previously owned an adata 32gb card which died after a couple weeksthe most annoying thing about large storage is copying files to it especially when the card is slow a class 4 would take well over 2 hours to fill up while this one takes just a bit over 45 minutesusing the antutu benchmark suite this card clocked in at 1mbs write and 217mbs readi did not have to format it or anything just popped it out of the packaging and threw it right into the sd slot of my phone,5.0

writeread speeds not up to par 32gb ultra micro sd card sdsdquaffpai would not recommend this card if your looking for real class 10 write speeds the most i could get is 9mbs from this card but for the most part it was about 78mbs i even did a slow format to exfat in windows 7 with no improvements i copied over music pics and movies to test it out ranging from a couple of mb to over a gb the read speeds were pretty good at around 21mbs though i popped in a 32gb class 10 transcend sd card and it consistently got 1618mbs write speeds and 24mbs read speeds so in conclusion i think this card is not really a class 10 too bad i read all the negative 1 star reviews after the fact but i will be sending this one back,1.0
cheap fast sd cardof late sandisk appears to have lost their way a little with their flash storage products it is almost a universal truth that all of their usb flash drives are hopelessly slow while they are usually reliable transfer rates of 4mbsec or less are worthless when filling a 32gb drive fortunately their ultra line of sd cards still appears to buck this trendformatted as ntfs and used in anelago mobile nano ii reader i see write speeds on a 64bit linux machine at a consistent 1516mbsec when copying large 1gb or larger files to this card which more than lives up to its class 10 billing reads appear to run at about 1920mbseci cannot comment on reliability as i have only had the card a few days but everything i have copied so far for testing has made it onto the card and off again with no corruption whatsoever the md5 checksum of every file i have transferred matches the source that is more than can be said for the supertalent pico usb drive that this sd card and reader are intended to replace which has never been quite right it is always occasionally randomly corrupted files of larger than 100mb or so and the probability of 1gb or greater files surviving was near zero32gb appears to be the sweet spot at the moment smaller cards do not cost that much less and larger cards are beyond the sdhc spec and into sdxc territory which is not yet universal in terms of device compatibility not to mention they cost far more than double for 64gbfor what i paid for this around thanksgiving not part of any explicit sale but definitely a lower price than appears usual as far as camelcamelcamel is concerned i am extremely satisfiededit i should also mention that the included mechanical fullsize sd adaptor is one of the worst i have ever encountered there is a lot of friction when the microsd card is inserted and it is a right bugger to get it out of the adaptor again thankfully i have a few other such adaptors lying around should i ever need one this ones going in the bin,5.0

great sd card butalot of storage for a great price only one probkem since i installed this card into my samsung galaxy note 3 about once a month or so when i turn the phone on in the morning it gets stuck in some sort of boot loop and hangs on the att logo screen my phone is stock and i have altered the software in no way granted i cannot be sure that the card is the cause of this problem but if i remove it and then boot the phone it works properly i love sandisk products and i will definitely continue to buy them just a word of warning,4.0
i forgetno problems at all using this in my samsung galaxy s i fit right in and started working i would suggest this to anyone,5.0
works very fast and perfectlyi got it and tested it block by block no issues i tested the speed in various applications and on my laptop in a good usb30 reader got no less than 4megsec and often a little over 10megsec speed will of course vary depending on all the hardware and what you are transferring,5.0
windows xp requires an updateif like me you are still happily in the stone age with windows xp your computer will not be able to use this card unless you install windows update kb955704 this update is available from microsoftcomthanks to dogg94 who pointed this out in customer questions and answers on august 6 2013 i installed this update and am now able to load gopros pictures onto my computer dogg94s answer to the customer question provides the link to the update amazon did not allow me to post the link here i do not know why just go to the microsoftcom updates site and look for kb955704 or go to the indicated question for the linkthe product description should have provided this information,5.0
you get what you pay fori have had cheaper sd cards in the past but they almost always wound up letting me down i made up my mind some time ago that i would stick with sandisk and have been completely satisfied with all my cards from them ever since this card sits in my wifes phone and is used to store all her music and pictures it has been in out close to a dozen times because i like to fiddle with stuff and as proven very durablein case anyone wants to know class 10 is the only way to go with these cards until they come out with something faster the readwrite speed is well worth the few extra bucks for my needsi also have a class 10 64 gb in my galaxy si and it is as good or better i even got it wet i mean soaked and it is still working like a charmi will definitely recommend this to anyone and will be sticking with sandisk for all my other devices,5.0
best of both worlds fast and reliableits hard to argue the quality of sandisk products and this one is no exception providing both a high capacity micro sd card and an adapter to allow it to be used in the larger sd form factor particularly nice for those of us who have a need for both,5.0
more space for note 3my wife and i just upgraded our phone to note 3 and wanted more space we had the phone for 4 days now and micro sd card works fine however i feel transfer rate is slow when transfering movies from my desktop to sd card 12gb movie will take about 1216 minutes i have pretty high end gaming pc intel i7 980x cpu 12gb memory 7870 ati graphic card 120gb ssd card 3tb hard drive for storage 1200w 80plus gold pus asus sabortooth motherboardand so on when transfering movies or file to my wd 25 inch external hard drive will take 12 minutes still satisfied since i have more than 90gb of storage on my phone,4.0
exactly what i wantedpurchased this to drop into my galaxy note ii exactly what i wantedloaded up the entirety of the card in about 18 minutes which is not super fast but very good considering the card was in the phone instead of in the computer using the include adapteri purchased this product with the worryfree packaging and was for the first time not frustrated with sandiskthe super saver shipping really sold the deal to methe price now is on par with most retailers but i got two duds from bestbuy and was good to go with the first one from amazon does not really say much about the product but gives you a bit of peace of mind when purchasing from this vendor,5.0
fasti got this not for the space but the speed class 4 is ok but class 10 is where its at copying files scanning the card cleaning caches writing files this thing grinds threw it all like nothing before it would take 2 minutes upon boot of my phone for my old class 4 32gb micro sd card would be done scanning with this its 7 seconds,5.0
works perfectly with galaxy s4from what i have read some galaxy users have had problems with microsd cards but this one works great so far lots of applications are willing to store their data on it and samsungs builtin camera is able to put its photos there instead of in the system memory so it helps free up a lot of space for applications and things that have to be in the system memory i have put all my mp3s on the card as well and they play back perfectly using both the samsung music application and google music,5.0

bought this for my gopro hero 3before doing research i assumed this card would support my brand new hero 3 camera considering it was sold off the gopro site it was a no brainer or so i thoughtanyhow the card seems to preform well under most circumstances without using the protunes settings the problems with the hero 3 where due to the slow write speed of this card under protunes settings without this setting the hero works finehowever after a few timelapse issues 2 5 sec timelapse which is well in this cards speedsi noticed the card is corrupt i tested this in other cameras and found that this problem still persists i trust sandisk as my top choice for all my professional work however this card has failedi would not recommend this expensive card id jump for a samsung or even the transcend cards they even come with a better warranty then this cardnothing but problems and lost memories that i cant replace,2.0

good buyitem arrived in time as promised works well with a galaxy note 101 there is nothing more to say about this product as it has been reviewed so many times it works well not a bad price at the time of ordering now it has come down yes you get the same card for lesser price from other sellers but i trust amazon for their customer service issues i prefer to pay 2 bucks more and get it from amazon rather than getting it from unfamiliar sellers,5.0
worked great for my wifes droid 3i had no problems transferring stuff over to it including 30 gb of songs it was much faster than offbrand i got this in 122012update 82013 i got my wife a new samsung galaxy s4 her old phone would only do 720p video and did not have a nice camera my wife is really into her photos so i was concerned it wouldnt keep up with the fancier camera after loading my now 33 gb of songs i got even more concerned in wouldnt keep up with the fancy new camera i bought one of the sandisk 64 gb extreme cards and was amazed at speed difference copying songs due to prior problems with generic cards i will only buy sandisk in futurenothing was wrong with the ultra card it just did not seem up to par to fully take advantage of the latestgreatest phone technology she is going to carry the old card in purse in case she fills first one,5.0

sandisk ultra 128 gb microsd card review by dalei bought two of these 128 gb microsd cards which i formatted to fat32 and i currently have about 62 gb in 350 files on each card i carry one card in my wallet and keep one in a safe deposit offsite i have been through the sandisk literature looking to see if there are any restrictions on their use other than as ordinary flash memory for file storage there are no restrictions i could find what i have found is that these 128 gb cards and a sandisk 64 gb card i bought previously cannot accept 62 gb of data written from a computer without suffering errors i have had to resort to copying no more than 13 gb of data at a time to these cards stopping then starting another 13 gb until the complete data is copied the errors actually occur early on at approximately the 2 to 3 gb point i have several other 128 gb flash memory sticks the lexar echo series as well as a hundred other lowercapacity flash memory cards and do not have this overflowerror problem with any of those to repeat there are no restrictions on the use of these memory cards example can be used only in a camera given by sandisk and given that the 62 gb of data on each card has been verified as to integrity they are not defective,3.0
outstanding very fast easy to use easy to overrightsimply excellent this is the second 32 gb ultra i have purchased for my samsung galaxy ii both are working perfectly data access rate is exceptional for movies system both stores and overrides data very easily,5.0

perfect for samsung galaxy s4 note 2 asus tf101before using i strongly suggest to format the card it only takes seconds with the sandisk i am able to transfer my images from the phone to the other phone or the tablet with no issuesmy old microsd was from pny when i purchased the phone they were giving the microsd card for free however it was only 2gb card i figured that it was time to upgrade since i only had about 20mb left of space on the card and the phone space was full due to pictures i spend several hours doing research for a good microsd card after reading couple articles online i found that all of my devices work great with microsdhcthere are a lot of choices to pick from on amazon however i was debating between sandisk transcend and samsung i started to read samsung microsd card reviews and the first reviews were from 2012 which were 1 star at least most of them due to the card not being a class 10 then i looked at the transcend card and the reviews were good but i was not so sure about the performance testso the third one i looked at was sandisk and it appears to be the best choice for my devices just because it had so many reviews i read a lot of reviews about this sd card and i was convinced to buy iti have downloaded sandisk memory zone for all of my devices the application provides more management functionality for complete control it allows to manage local and cloud memory meaning you can move files from your phone to box dropbox google docs picasa sugarsync skydrive or from the cloud storage to the phone the application allows to secure files with a password,5.0

great large capacity cardas soon as i saw that this card was announced on the various tech sites out there i knew that i had to buy one i went to amazon and picked one up for 120 this is a steep price compared to 64gb cards but this is the largest capacity commercially available and i do not want to be swapping out micro sd cards that is just so inconvenient i did various speed tests on this card and can confirm that you can get 30mbs read speed fastest i saw was a little over 40mbs write speed varied greatly and seemed to decrease the larger the file got minimum write speed i saw was just under 10 mbs i use this on my samsung galaxy note 3 and have not have any issues with it,5.0

great carduse this card for my slr works fantastic and allows me to use burst mode to its full capacity 10fps i tried it in my samsung mp3 player and it works but randomly shows no data and needs a reboot to fix in all fairness it could be the device or software so i cannot deduct a star for that,5.0

damaged card but may not be sellers faultbought this card for my galaxy s4 and after installing it and loading my music the card was randomly ejecting itself after like the 3rd ejection of the morning the phone reported that the card needed to be reformatted because it was damaged so i reformatted the random sdcard ejection and damaged card kept coming up after googling i read that the galaxy series phones are known to have compatibility issues with sandisk cards and its a hit or miss some phones have no issues i have replaced this card already which amazon shipped me a 2nd card within a few days but the same problems arise not sure if i should switch to a different brand but this card is definitely useless to me for the time being maybe i can give it away to a friend who does not have an s4,2.0

excellent large 64 gb high performance microsd cardsi purchased two of these microsdxc cards when they were on sale around black friday and have been using them now for just about two months they work wonderfully and i have had absolutely no problems with either these sandisk memory cards are 64 gb microsdxc class 10 uhs1 cards which are rated for transfer speeds up to 30mbsecthe uhs class 1 designation is intended as an performance measure that indicates the card is capable of supporting realtime full hd video recording of course this only works if you are using a device which is capable of writing to the card at those speeds but most modern devices that offer full hd recording such as camcorders digital slr cameras and cell phones with built in full hd recording do support this standard the benefit of using a uhs1 card on a uhs certified device is that you should not encounter the problem of buffering or your device stopping recording because it could not write fast enoughhowever because these are extra high capacity sdxc cards you will need to make sure that your device can support microsdxc cards and not simply microsd or microsdhc ones the biggest difference is that the microsdxc standard uses the exfat file system rather than the fat32 or ntfs systems while most modern android devices and in fact most linuxunix devices can handle that without difficulty some devices such as older cameras android devices and some windows devices may have difficulty with the formathaving said that i have been using these in nikon d80 d70 digital slr cameras as well as samsung galaxy s3 and galaxy s relay 4g phones without any difficulty and they read write fine on my computers all in all these were a great buy and i am very happy with them,5.0

exceeded what the other reviewers are claimingi found the write bandwidth of this card is 15mbsec when transferring a steady stream dozens of gigabytes the included full sized sdcard adapter appears to be slightly faster than my usb adapter i tested by piping devurandom through pv onto the card read bandwidth appears to be 181 mbsec,5.0

used in my samsung galaxy i must be taped in though no issues at alli have this card in my samsung galaxy it has been in there now for about 8 months with no issuesokay it had one issue but that was the phone design itself it would unmount if the phone was moved around roughly it seems to pop out very easy in the samsung galaxy phones so i solved the problem by putting some electrical tape on it to hold it in so far after 8 months it has not unmountedit will give you an ungodly amount of storage on this phone if your wondering if your samsung phone will take this card it will with no issues it shows a total of 596 gb of available space once installed a must have since most phones come with 8 gb of internal memory nowadays,5.0

works for my applicationbought both this and a similar transcend premium 300x 32 gb microsdhc class 10 uhs for a couple of g1wh dash cams both work well with the cameras the key is you need cards compliant with uhs 1 or better look for the you with a 1 or a 3 inside it on the card for these cameras the transcend is rated slightly faster but the cameras seem to like either equally well when i purchased this transcend and the sandisk were within pennies of each other so aside from slight price and speed differences there is not much to recommend one over the other and so long as you get at least a uhs 1 card the same can be said for other manufacturers such as gskill kingston or others,5.0

maximum sdhc storage capacity coupled with sandisks reliability and speedi bought this card because i have several devices that use microsd cards but not all of them are compatible with the newer and highercapacity sdxc standard for sdhc memory cards 32gb is the largest size available under that technology standard so i went with this one from sandisk that way i did not have to worry about compatibility issues with any of my devices i have used sandisk memory products for a number of years along with many other brands and i have always had good results from them i am happy to say that my experience with this card echoes that of 50 other amazon users it is been rock steady reliable with larger file transfers several 2gb movies at a time and performed as quickly as i would hoped for a class 10 card in regards to its readwrite timesaside from the existing reviews and my previous experiences with sandisk products i also picked up this particular card due to its uhs1 compliance i do not currently have any uhs1 devices that can take advantage of the increased speed but for the negligible cost difference it just made sense standards and technology update so fast these days any futureproofing a product can provide to extend its usable life is always appreciated,5.0

problems formatting fault of my pci had problems using the chip in the reader built into my laptop it seemed to only want to format up to 32gb when i plugged it into my phone i could format at 64 gb but then the laptop reader saw it as empty when i used a usb reader then the laptop could read it just finei was able to copy the 4gb of data from my old microsd to this chip and have not had any problems with it yet,5.0

unbelievably slowthis is called class 10 so i ordered it figuring it would have useable speed i plugged it in to copy about 9gb of program installation files i was totally dumbfounded that it took about 3 hours to copy those files onto this ultra class 10 sdxc card 9gb on my superslow supercheap plastic schoolkid usb thumb drive takes less than 10 minutes so then i tested it on various known computers with typical raw and jpg picture files read speeds ranged from 1525mbs while write speeds ranged from 48mbsec for big files and below 1mbsec for small files this is what i would call largely unusable very disappointing,2.0

it is goodworks fine as sandisk usually does i know there is a lot of discussion about transfer rates and so forth but i am fine if the rate is not so fast or slow i really do not care long as it holds and keeps the data until i can transfer it all these cards seem to me to be about the same sandisk is the big name and so i usually stick with it but i have other makes that are just as good,4.0

be wary do not hesitate to returni bought two cards for tablets the first wouldnt format so i bought another gskill class 10 the second worked but only for 35 minutes then error or freeze i thought it may have been the tablets however the gskill worked in bothso i called amazon the customer service was excellent there may have been a problem with one of their vendorsthey shipped out two new cards with saturday delivery it was implied through lengthy conversation with the amazon agent that there were numerous problems with a particular companyvendorlesson do not hesitate to call and return if you get a card that seems to have any troubles out of the packi was surprised that my initial review was removed from amazonso i am leaving another about the return ii tried everything to fix these cards fat32 ntfs and the newest exfat there are definitely some damaged cards out there so be wary and do not hesitate to call customer service,1.0

works mostlyi bought this to put in my olympus pen epm1 camera which takes a standard sd card therefore it must go into the adapter to be put into the camera unfortunately there is something touchy about this sometimes i turn the camera on and get a card error sometimes i can pop the card out and back in and it will work this past weekend i could not get it to work at all i am guessing it is the camera or maybe the adapter when i plugged the card and adapter into my computer to copy the pictures off it worked perfectly so i am not sure what the problem is i make sure to always carry a spare normal sd card with my camera in case this one stops working,4.0

bigger and bettercameras are getting smaller and smaller at the same time their resolution is getting better and better in order to take full advantage of your pixels your files get larger and larger ultimately rendering small sized picture cards less handy most cameras now let you take a minimovie which also eats up space quite quicklythis sandisk card gives you the ability to store considerably more information in a neat small footprint if you do want to go with this card make sure it is compatible with your equipment not every camera takes every card so you have to do some due diligence,5.0

very cheap and very biga very cheap way of expanding memory on your phone i have bought this because of the 8 mp camera on my phone which means that memory gets used up quickly this is also a good quality card i usually find sandisk products last at least a year before breaking and even longer if you keep them in the device,5.0
can i give it negative stars worked well at firsti guess i should be happy it failed after only 1 month because i only lost 1 months worth of pictures and so on i bought 3 of these cards for my wife son and i my wifes had a minor glitch which went away with a reboot mine had a minor glitch this morning so i expected the reboot to fix it no a reboot caused my motorola defy xt to tell me the card was blank and needed to be formatted my laptop would not even recognize the card when i put the card in it is reader after a couple hours of looking for a way to fix it i have only found that this is very common for this specific cardedit i was very happy with sandisk after calling them they did say there are compatibility issues with class 10 cards and some of the android phones and verified my phone is one of them they offered free replacement with a card that would be certain not to have the same issue mine just had and also to attempt recovery of my items from the card these are the reasons we buy sandisk in the first place they did recommend a class 4 or lower card to me for this phonei am leaving this as a 1 star because people should be aware of compatibility issues this severe2nd edit as of march 12 this replacement card that was not going to be susceptible to the same type of failure is losing applications and so on i am giving this card up it has taken my phone and turned it into a device i cannot count on,1.0

great capacity good speedits hard to believe they can cram 32gigs of memory into a device this tiny and also get good speed out of file transfers to and from it it is a good thing it comes with an adapter for larger size devicesi recommend keeping it in that adapter at all times unless it is inside something like a cell phone which only takes the microsd size it is way too easy to lose something this small i hate the industrys mad rush to make everything smaller and smaller with no regard to usability anyway the memory card is great outside of that and since my phone does take microsd i just keep it plugged in at all times and do not have to worry about it,5.0

plusses and minusesstart at four starsplus one star because it is finally a 128gb sd card i have been longing for this for quite some timeminus one star because its performance is spotty i have been using one in a surface pro for a couple months now and while the write speeds will peak at a sustained 15mbsec it often slows to 1 or 2 even in the middle of a large file copy i assume that is due to typical flash memory erase cycles or something but i cannot imagine it would be at all reliable for recording video to in your phonein the end i like it well enough to get two but it is really only good for mass storage with low bandwidth requirements,4.0

fast read slow write with a usb 30 card reader crystaldiskmark shows blazing fast 47mbs read but disappointingly slow 13mbs write speed so you can pretty much forget about reliable 1080p video recordingupdate it is correct that write speed great than 10mbs is enough for 1080p recording i need to clarify that the card is very slow when uhs1 is not enabled the readwrite speeds drop to 13379 mbs for devices that are a few years old such as canon t2i which does not support uhs 1080p recording may not be reliable this card is classified as class 10 it should support sustained write speed of at least 10mbs without uhs it fails my test as observed by other reviewers as well,2.0

i had a comptibility issueworks great in my modern phone and tablet however i was unable to use it on my pcs sd card reader it appears the older card readers are not compatible with class 10 as both my new cards could not be written to without the operating system win7 reporting write errorsi probably should blame the card reader but it never failed me until trying to write to this card,4.0

perfect so farby default it is formatted in exfat so do not expect your devices will recognize it if they do not support this system the miss standard allows only 32 gb for fat32 but who cares there are free tools to format all 64 as fat32 i personally used linux and got it done in couple minutes it was recognized by samsung tablet note 101 right away i will definitely buy one more for my other devices one point to the people complaining about the speed both your device and adapter should support the speeds over 20 mbs if you try to usetest this card using usb2 then do not complain you got what you wanted,5.0

memorable deal very satisfying purchaseneeded to increase the storage capacity of my core i5 samsung series 7 slate pc which was em equipped lwith a 128gb ssd this 64gb memory card fit the bill perfectly did my research cconfirmed a micro sdxc card and 64gb capacity can work in the memory card slot of my windows 7 pro slate device purchased the memory card at a very attractive price amazon was offering a daily deal at the same time period i needed the product memory card arrived without delay packaging was very siimple worry freefor real plugged sd card in my slate pc card slot formatted card to exfat vs ntfs after more research and i was ready to go transferred my photos and music from ssd to the sd card freed up valuable ssd real estate for os use and my slate pc is again humming with lot more ssd space available plays back music video photo slideshows smoothly from the card delivers on function very satisfied with purchase and highly recommended 5 stars no hesitation,5.0
solid memory good pricea good size and good price for a small camera or phone that takes micro sd memory this is fast but not hyped as aighsuperspeedy because it does not need to be it is good for all the standard usages of your average consumer photos ringtones games lightweight video and so on,5.0
finallyi for one have not bought into googles or anybody elses idea that streaming everything is so great with all the regressive data caps and sketchy throughput i never want to rely on something being available to me online much better to have it local and with this new card i can finally pack all of my music 56gb all of my photos dozens of reference ebooks and a few videos to boot and still i have around 9gb free as breathing room for my podcatcher the only real bummer with this card is the speed just as i got acclimated to sandisks 64gb extreme plus level of speed going back to ordinary class 10 speed that this card has is a little painful luckily playing music or even playing videos does not oversaturate the read performance what will trip you up however is doing a straightforward copy or move operation while youre listening to something this card does not seem to handle multiple simultaneous operations without something going awry so long as you understand it is limitations and you can live with them the enormous amount of storage you can pack into your phone or tablet is very welcomeso far i have used one of these in a samsung galaxy note 2 n7100 lg g pad and a sony xperia z1 compact all with success,4.0
yikes i forgot to bring my regular card with medo you have different devices that require either regular or micro cards have you ever forgotten to bring one no worries if you have an adapter like this to get both the micro card and the adapter for one low price is fantastic if you do not get one you have no one to blame but yourself,5.0
great sdxc cardwhat more can be said it is a great card with plenty of storage space to handle or expand your tablet camera or video cameras needs with the included sd card adapter the micro card can be read in any sd card readerwriter it is initially formatted in some format that my windows 8 pro miss surface pro could read or see but from another laptop using the sd adapter i was able to reformat it and make it usable for the surface progreat card for a great price,5.0

works fine in my phonei use this in my samsung galaxy si and it has been great there have been a few instances when the card was not recognized but simply rebooting the phone fixed the problem i am unsure whether this is a samsung issue probably or a sandisk issue but it has only happened 2 to 3 times over the course of a year and a half overall the write speeds are fast enough that you can record 1080p video directly to the card which is exactly what i wanted it for it does come with a fullsize sd card enclosure allowing you to use this in devices that require that type of memory card recommended,4.0
great pricealways the worry that an sd card is a fake even at retail stores but no issues here and the price is great,5.0

great for my phonei bought this card as a music expansion for my samsung s4 and it handles that task deftly i do not know how it would work in an intense need of speed environment but it is perfect for my purposes,5.0
posif this was any more worthless it would have a retched stench this card has completely turned me away from ever trusting another sandisk product again i would only use this in the future to keep corrupt misinformation to frustrate anyone attempting to acquire any of my datai have reformatted it 34 times in full using various allocation sizes and operating systems it only functions under windows it randomly works in my mobile devices now i am left to decide if i want to bother researching this to better understand the problem in the future or simply purchase another card from a more reliable manufacturer hello kingston,1.0
very satisfiedworks as expected i suspect this is why so many people trust sandisk i hope they stick with maintaining the integrity their products have earned i often pay a little more from sandisk but i have never been disappointed with their products as i have others like adata in fairness to adata who failed to make good on any of the several defective products i purchased from them i have never had to test sandisks warranty as i have never had a failure perhaps their product support is just as bad as adatas but i have never had the opportunity to test it,5.0

good productit is exactly what it is advertised to be shipped fast and i love the converter that comes with it so i can plug it into my computer,4.0
true to classi big problem i have been having lately is finding a trustworthy source for sd cards they are manufactured in china and these rip off companies are selling fake cards at a competitive price but do not be fooled if the price seems unbelievable that is because you will end up with a card that is not only less capacity then you are paying for but a lower class and sometimes a faulty card altogetherwhen it comes to storage pay the extra cash to get something reliable like this sandisk ultra 64 gb sdxc class 10 memory card it is blazaing fast and works well in my htc evo lte android phoneside note this card brings my total phone storage capacity to 158 gb that is 158 gb that i have full access to 85 gb of which is synced to the cloud,5.0

excellent solutioni got this to expand the memory storage in my samsung galaxy note 101 the tablet and paperwork claim to support up to 32gb but other reviews for these cards and the note 101 said that a 64gb worked just fine and work just fine it doesi store mostly music on here as i have got over 22gb worth of music which would have taken up most of the 32gb built in to the tablet i also use my tablet for sheet music so i needed to have the capability to have all that on there too so this was my best solution and so far it is worked wonderfullyand on top of that it came with a microsd card to sd card adapter making file transfers even easier overall i would highly highly recommend this product,5.0

fast small and inexpensiveit is almost unbelievable that these micro sd cards can range in sizes up to 64gb and at a class 10 to boot pun intendedcomes with the sd adapter so it will work in any device that uses and sd or micro sd memory card just be sure to check whether or not your device can handle the extra memory some devices with recognize only 8 gb or 16 gb which means that unless you check with the manufacturer it is your fault you bought the wrong size memory and you will not be able to exchange due to your mistakethis card used to cost upwards of 120 not that long ago and now they are ridiculously cheap especially for the quality and capacity you are gettingthanks,5.0

installed effortlessly fast and economicali was out of space on my droid razr 16gb and still had an empty microsd slot so i figured i would pick this up seeing as how it is a reputable brand in flash memory i am glad i went with the sandisk ultra because there is seemingly no difference in speed between this drive and the builtin internal memory of my phone i record a lot of videos with my phone and i have been recording straight to this card in hd with no problems at allinstallation was a breeze i took the memory card out of the package and inserted into my phone then my phone brought up a menu asking if i wanted to move my music videos and photos to the memory card i selected all three categories and in minutes it had moved all of my media onto the memory card i did not even have to do anything else i had read some other reviews that said they had to reformat the card or mess around with moving files by hand but i did not have to do any of thati have not tried using the included sd adapter yet but i imagine it will work as well as any other adapter the adapter and memory card were both shipped in a little clear plastic case which makes it easier to carry the adapter around with you so you have it with you when you need itthe price on this card when i bought it was a few dollars more than the generic brands i decided to spend a few extra dollars on it since i would be really upset if i lost all my photos and videos due to a corrupt memory card i am very satisfied with the product and i would highly recommend it to anyone looking to increase the storage capacity of their phone or anything else this would fit in,5.0

fast affordable waterproofok so my dad needed a microsd for his gs3 galaxy s 3 because he was using way to much space with videos and pictures he is not one of the most tech saavy people in the world so i got this for him does it work yes it does and very well i might add like i said my dad does not work to well with tech and if a microsd slowed his phone down when it saved pictures or videos or ran applications from it he wouldnt be happy and wouldnt know what to do with the problem this card experiences no lag 3 months in the uhsi speed class really lives up to its potential here best of all perhaps a little known fact to most of you this card is waterproof so you get your phone wet and it dies do not worry this card is still perfectly fine just pop it in a new phone and there is all your stuff no cons as of yet will update as needed,5.0

fastest sd everi love this micro sd because i used it as my main memory phone mostly because the galaxy s4 it comes with a 9gb of free space so i can pretty much just enjoy this ultra 64gb for music photos and movies but not for applications because my phone is not compatible with moving applications to the sd it stills works for other phones but not this one i have to say this is one of the fastest micro sd i ever bought recommended a lot,5.0
fast hugeplenty of room for all my photos music and random documents i decide to load onto my phone it works great with my htc one mate and applications stored on the sd card run as smooth as they did on the phone itself file writes were as fast as i expected from an xc i cardthe only downside and this is minor is the microsd adapter it comes with seems a little cheap but hey that is not the reason i bought this card,5.0

runs very very hot but reliablei purchased 2 of these 1 for my htc incredible phone and the other for use in a key chain storage device both of these cards run very very hot after copying over 4gb of files it was almost scalding to the touch but both have been reliable with only a few issues of reading them both times in the thumb drive adapter so that may have been at fault and not the card itself,4.0
warningnot for android phonesespecially galaxy class 6 motherboardcould not figure out why this card crashed multiple times in my samsung galaxy si and demanded a reformatting then after 5hrs of calls to sprint samsung i got a guy who reads factory stuffsamsung galaxy si is a class 4 class 6 supported motherboard with qualcomm processor the sprint stores only sell class 4 memory and there is a reason that camera memoryclass 10 is not sold there the board just like in a pc has to support the data stream it does notif you have an android phone you better make sure the motherboard supports it even samsungs usa website does not tell you the board supported memory they would not and do not tell who the board manufacturer is in this galaxy si phone i asked at the texas samsung advanced tech support center after 1hr on hold and they had no specs to even share they do not get itpass if you have a cell phone unless you get it in writing from the motherboard manufacturer of your phone i went through this same stuff building custom pcs with intel motherboards memory has to be built to run on this board at this speed with this processor or it will not work properly and will crash and lose data,1.0

perfect for gopro 3hdi operate a commercial whitewater rafting company and we buy these bulk whilst renting out gopros and selling the footage along with the card to the customer weve never had a bunk card or any problems whatsoever over about 40 cards so far i was advised by my gopro rep to be sure to buy from a name brand like sandisk the adapter is well appreciated by the customer not only because most people dont have a port for the micro format but also because microsd is so ridiculously small that its far too easy to losehave and will buy again,5.0

love all sandisk microsdhc class 10 cardsi do not want to write a review for each of the 8 16 32 and 64 gb sandisk microsdhc class 10 cards they are all 5 stars they are extremely fast and as class 10s have allowed my canon sx50s shutter to speed up because it transfers information so quickly with the cameras very small processor they also allow a burst mode of 913 fps which is amazing for a nondslrthese cards are also very reliable i have had no readwrite failures in the two years that i have been using themthe one negative is that they are so small and can be dropped easily when getting them out of the adapter still if youve been working with computers since there was a gerbil running the power for your pc you have to marvel at how anything this small can hold more than 30 high def 6 gb photos on a 64 gb card that is smaller than your pinky nail,5.0
it works finenot much to say about this other than it works fine the included adapter was difficult to remove the microsdhc card from but that may be due to my big fingers plus the card is very small as one would expect from micro naming the speed is more than adequate with no buffering issues noticed from video capture on a phone at hd720 resolution recommended,5.0

simply the besti use sandisk exclusively for serious prosumer work including 4 hour concert videos i have never had a problem in 3 years and wouldnt use anything else,5.0
outstanding performancei bought this to stash all the ones i would watch on the go the movies and songs that i previously owned to my new galaxy s4 i am extremely impressed with how fast the device works outside of the phone and inside when used by the phone it is dramatically slow when the phone with the sd card in it is wired up to the computer via usb but that is really unrelated and the process isnt painstaking fast and huge in capacity definitely a must for enthusiastsnote as of ics android has stopped allowing the movement of applications into the sd card so if youre planning on installing games onto the card you will need to have a rooted phone the card is very useful for other things music and video and roms if youre interested even then,5.0
does what it shouldtransfers at about 10mbs not super speedy but it allows me to run software from it on my windows tablet,5.0

seems to work finei purchased this micro memory card for my global positioning system when i updated the maps recently the global positioning system ran out of room and i could no longer put the entire us map in it this card fits neatly into the global positioning system slot and adds enough memory for the global positioning system to work i have not had this fix in place for long so do not know about how well it will continue to work the adapter looks to be handy if i have another use for the card,5.0

64gb sdxc works perfectly with samsung galaxy note 101i was a bit concerned when i first ordered this microsd card samsungs documentation says it is compatible with an sdhc card but this one is sdxc i read a bunch on google about incompatibilities but they were older forum discussions i read the sdxc used to be incompatible but that samsung published an update late last year that allowed the galaxy note 101 to work with this card without the need for reformatting to a fat file system for the price i thought i did not have much to lose and would give this a shotmy report the galaxy note 101 read the card perfectly when installed there was a small glitch where the note asked to format the card after i removed it from the tablet and transferred about 25gb of data to the card from my pc while it was in a card reader all i needed to do was to remove the card again and reinsert and reboot the tablet and the problem went away have been using this for hours doing extensive readwrites to the card with no failures will update if i have any issues but for now i am extremely pleased with the performance on this,5.0

cannot formati wanted to believe that those people who wrote bad reviews on memory cards were just unlucky well it sucks being one of them i cannot get this card to format not matter what device software or technique i use the mistake i made was that i did not use the card right away to see if it was good i thought its a memory card what could go wrong now i am out of the us and returning it is not economically sensible i do not know if it is quality control but this card simply cannot work in any reader device with or without adapter write protection off on the reader of course the card shows up on devices may even show data being copied then when you refresh nothing has happened all formatting software says it is write protected and nothing i do can remove it why would a new card come write protected anyway very disappointing especially since i lost data from my phone,1.0

use nothing other than the bestpuchased this card right after i received my samsung galaxy s i truly found this to be quicker than any other class 10 card i have owned the cost on amazon was far less than i have seen anywhere else if youre looking for this type of product then this is the one for youin my humble opinion of course,5.0
does the job with photo and videoi use sandisk ultra sdhc cards for photo and video and have always been satisfied when it came to needing a microsdhc for a gopro i purchased this card it provides the same reliability consistency and workflow as the larger sdhc cards and with the included adapter it easily installs in my current sdhc card reader it also means i can use it as a back up for my sdhc cards should the need arise giving an extra 32 gb as a spare card good card at a good price,5.0

works just finethis is a really small card but it holds the data and does the job it comes with an adapter allowing the card to be used in a laptop or card reader it has worked well for me so far and has my recommendation,5.0
great cardthis is one of the better reviewed sdhc class 10 cards that utilized uhs by reading the reviews you will see that it readswrites at a better speed than many or most cards out there right now much depends on your phone how your phones os stores information on a card and whats inside your device for most of us you probably will not notice anything different between this card and any other good quality card out there i usually pick the fastest cards on the market when the prices drop the main problem speed related is when you transfer large amounts of data usually music onto any card if you use a standard usb 2 connection this card would not speed that process up if you use a usb 3 or if you actually put this card into a usb 3 reader to do the transfer then youll see a nice boost if your device requires a card that the product can utilize and has the os and chipset to take advantage of this fast card it is a no brainer if your device is older if you just like storing music then you can find a cheaper good quality card if you find this at a good price no matter what you have buy it,5.0
great it works with samsung note 3 tooafter a long research about the sd cards i came across this deal i wanted an sd card for my new samsung note 3 none of the review was talking about note 3 most of the reviews were either about note 2 or s4a few reviews were talking about possible problem of not able to recognize the card and getting into the cycle where you have to call sandisk i was not sure to go for it or not although choices were very thin samsung cards were way out of my budgetso i decided to take a chance and i am happy that i didit is working smoothly no need to format just works great one star for not exactly 64 gb it shows up 59gbi will again update this post after 1 month when i will really sure it has no problem,4.0

1 of them failed after 2 months of use mixed results overallsandisk ultra class 10 micro sdhc card 16gb 32gb and 64gbi purchased the 32gb card for my samsung galaxy s3 and the 16gb card for another video recording device i formatted both cards in fat32 using windows 7 and functioned without drama in the respective devices i purchased the 64gb for my gopro hero3 silver editionthe reason i chose the sandisk ultra is for the class 10 speed rating as well as the waterproof shockproof vibration proof and xray proof durability i had the 32gb sandisk fail after 2 months of easy usage in my samsung galaxy s3 i do not abuse my phone and it is not subject to extreme temperaturevibrations sandisk replaced it under warranty but it was quite a hassle to do thisthe 16gb card however has been subject to extreme temperatures for well over 4 months from 5f to 100f and that does not include solar loading from sitting under the sun as well as 100 humidity the 16gb card was dripping with water after i experienced water intrusion in one of my cameras and it had been soaked in water while operating for several monthsthe packaging was easy to open by simply cutting across the top however finagling out the blister pack took some patience the frustration free packaging is essentially a cardboard envelope sleeve with a plastic holder and the sd card adapter with microsd card inside this is how it is shippedoverall 45 stars very affordable and decently fast micro sd cards these are perfect for smartphones or recording devices used in extreme environments however one of them failed within 2 months the speeds are also inconsistent i posted a benchmark photo on amazon showing my speeds with all 3 sizes of cards and the 32gb was the fastestupdate 28 oct 2012my 32gb card has failed after just over 2 months of use in my samsung galaxy s3 phone it started dismountingremounting intermittently by itself over night i woke up this morning to find that the card is not readable via the phone and wouldnt work on my pc the phone has not been abused and was not used in an extreme environment this card was replaced under warranty by sandisk,4.0

solid performance with great speeds for hd playback on ultrabookstabletsi am primarily using this to supplement storage on my microsoft surface pro and have a small library of movies and tv shows to carry around while i am on the go a lot of ultrabooks and the like come with just 128gb of storage and i think this sd card is a great way to store some media while you save room on the harddrive for your program installations and so on the speeds i am seeing are consistently around the peak that the card is rated for and work great for playback of my lossless mkv movie files recorded at a high bluray quality bitrate i have also tried it with my android smartphone and i am seeing similarly high peakperformance speeds for file transfer and smooth playback of media it comes with an adapter to convert it to the standard sd card size in use with devices like slr cameras and so on so youll be covered under almost any circumstance i only wish i could buy a larger capacity model but as it stands i think with the amazon sale prices that regularly come for this product it is a great deal,5.0

great qualitythe sandisk ultra is a very high quality micro sd card i have bought several and have never had an issue with any of them which i cannot say about less expensive cards if you need a card for your smart phone or tablet this is it just make sure not to get a bigger capacity card than your device can use,5.0
works great the second timethe first one had some sort of problem and would stop responding to the phone or stop playing music a reboot often fixed it for a period of time but inevitably it would stop again amazon replaced the unit quickly and the replacement works perfectly i am so glad it was not my phone i have almost 10 songs on my phone now who needs a separate music player it would easily handle video photos or a monster application collection as well it is great taking a modest capacity phone and making it bigger than anyone else offers stock for far less than you can buy the phone with the extra capacity,5.0

getting at best 13mbps transfer ratei purchased this card on a daily lighting deal for my new samsung galaxy note ii it was recognized without issues i connected it with its adapter to my computers card reader to transfer about 3gb of data and the best consistent transfer rate average was roughly 13mbps that is less than 50 of the advertised transfer rateto be fair i have used the same external card reader with my sony hx100 digital camera with an sd card 16gb class 10 and i get double the transfer rate of what i have gotten for this cardhere is the setup1 sd adapter included with this card2 external 12in1 usb 20 card reader connected to a usb 20 port on my pc3 files transferred were of varying sizes4 transferred from 2tb seagate x2 sata3 hdd connected to sata2 port5 windows 8 enterprise x64 oh yah babythe only excuse i give this card for its bad performance is the files were relatively small sizes but some of them were as large as 50mb this still does not justify the very low transfer ratei am not really picky because this card will reside inside my super phone but still it does not justify the money paid for this cardi hope this will help others,3.0

very disappointedafter doing some tests between a generic memory card and this sandisk i am very disappointed i bought the 32 gig class 10 cardi swore i picked original packaging but it was shipped with out original packaging i will be returning this card for the following reasonsthese tests were done using the sd card ports on my pcmy generic class 6 32 gig card has upload speed of 22mb write and a transfer speed of 85my sandisk i just bought it has an upload speed peaking at 32mb write and a transfer speed of 65 to maybe 85 if im luckythe write speed is ok but why is the transfer speed so much more low why isnt it at least 10mb if not 12mb if sandisk is typically so modest in their classificationsand whats the deal with the no classification marking on this sd card i dont see class 10 anywhere on this cardamazon you will be getting this back,1.0

love it but it is not cheapclass 10 has a cost i am wondering today how we did manage with 500mb cards when a few minutes of shooting a 1080p video do take so much space i calculated that i could be able to record no more than about 5 hours of 1080p movies with this 64gb micro sdon the other hand the micro card itself is so tiny about the size of one of my nails miniaturization has gone a long wayin any case i did put this into my gopro 3 camera and it recognized and formatted it immediately no issue at all,5.0

just as you expect it to bebought it while it was one sale for 35 i love itit has given my surface some wiggle roomdo not expect the read and write speed to be super fast most likely you computer does not support the current protocol to transfer at the max speedoverall quality you expect from sandisk though i think the price of this can come down bit more now that the market is slowly moving away from microsd expansion aside from samsung,4.0

fell out a lot from the side of the tabletthe chip worked fine fit perfectly but it is so tiny if it falls out you are going to have a hard time finding itif your application is a tablet or pad if it has a pushin holderyou will want to put some tape or other securing agent across the top of the chip and onto the table sides if i had thought of it clear finger nail polish would have worked just fine or even a half drop of super glue on the topi did not and it is forever gone now i changed from android to ipad and very satisfied that i upgraded to apple,3.0

will work on android tabletsi have read many places that this would not work on android tablets but have found that the card requires you to format in a windows computer to get it to work even tablets that are rated to 32gb have been found to read write this card to 64gb you need to download a free partitioning program and format using that to fat32 first erase the current partition then repartition to 64gb then format you cannot simply use windows to format to fat32 on newer windows computers and even on older vista the max it will allow is 32gb at fat32 using the partitioning software bypasses that 32gb limit and formats the whole card so that when you after insert into tablet reads something like 594gb formatted space huge capacity for the money and a fast card search internet for formatting 64gb microsd card for android and read up on it,5.0

so far so goodi have had this memory card for about 4 days i ordered it with my new galaxy s4 verizon worked perfectly out of the box did not have to format and read write speeds meets up to my expectations i will still keep my eyes on this card for little longer because i see some reviews reporting that cards fail after some time but seems to be ok for menot relevant to this product but i did get ontrac shippingamazon prime 2 day shipping for this memory card and my galaxy s4 after reading so many negative reviews and feedback about this shipping company i was crossing my fingers and hoping that they wouldnt do something stupid to my package fortunately i got my package on time and nothing was damaged one minor complain is that ontrac does not update their tracking history very often or at allbased on my other purchases as i was phoneless for couple days and really needed a phone i checked the tracking history probably once every couple hours it was showing that it has left the faculty for 2 12 days and was not updated at all until about an hour before i got my package saying that it went out for delivery on 9am i received my package around 5pm again i got my package on time with no problem so i am ok but with the history of ontrac being so rubbish it just made me worry because i did not wanted to be phoneless for 23 weeks,5.0
worked with my crappy phone nexus one and crappy computercompatibility should not be an issue with these memory cards even though they are sdhc they are very backwards compatible i threw a 32 gb in my phone for extra storage and i have had no issues with it make sure you move applications from your phone to your sd card storage though it is future proof and you can hide important files on it if you want,5.0
works wellsimply put it is a 32 gb microsdhc card that came in the mail when it said it would it was empty when i got it it works as expected it holds files images and so on and it has the adapter included voila,5.0
not bad for being so tinyi bought this card because i hope to transition from a pc to a smartphone in the near future for now i use an adapter to run it on the pc the write times are not as good as i had hoped but they are acceptable overall plenty of storage space for my files some of my music pics that sort of thing have also run portable applications on it and they seem to perform well for the most part overall a solid little card with just enough speed to get the majority of my tasks donesidenote the card came formatted with exfat by default the onyl way i could downgrade to fat32 was to use a third party application for some reason the card cannot be read by my phone but the phone is an older model samsung so that could be the issue,4.0

great storage and fast speed for copying digital slr photos and mp3si figured out why my old microsd card died on me when i plugged in my old android phone at work the antivirus software of my laptop wanted to scan the whole thing every time i was plugging it in to charge it but the constant reads wore out the flash my new android phone mounts as a cd drive instead of the entire thing i can only see the phone if i unmount my cd drive this is perfect for charging at work now be careful with virus scanners if you have an android phone that auto mounts your entire phones micro sd,5.0

started corrupting filesupdate 61814 well i suppose nothing lasts forever after almost a year the card has gone bad i use the card a lot in my smartphone a tmobile samsung galaxy s3 sght9 all my photos voice recordings and downloads go on this card and the downloads are transferred to my computer almost daily via usb cable a few days ago a video file i transferred to my computer refused to play correctly no video and the audio was skipping and squealing which i recognize as the sound of a corrupted file i thought maybe the transfer did not complete tried it again same result i tried to play the file right on the phone and it did not play on my phone i knew there was a problem i tried copying the video to my phone storage and playing it there still no luck then i deleted the video and decided to download it directly to my phone not the sd card eureka it played perfectlyi formatted the sdxc card twice once from the phone and once through windows and tried the same test downloaded video file to the card then to the phone same result both times it wouldnt play on the sd card but it did on the phone all videos used to play perfectly on the sd card finally i swapped out the card for my older sandisk ultra 32gb micro sdxc card like magic it worked perfectly no matter what i played on it so yeah the 64gb card is dead i should note that the card performed flawlessly for nearly a year up until a few days agothankfully sandisk ultra products like this carry an incredible lifetime warranty or 10 years for regions that do not recognize lifetime their extreme line of cards raise that to 30 years i have contacted their support for an rma so i will update this review as events unfold if they replace it quickly i will bump this back up to 5 starsoriginal reviewi am using a samsung galaxy s3 smartphone sandisk ultra micro sd cards have never failed me and this ones no exception i used to have a 32gb card they are fast and reliable and never corrupt data which is more than can be said for some cheaper brands like pny those fail quite often i cannot wait to get the new 128gb model,3.0

works great without a hitchit got it because my sandisk 32gb was getting full and had about 23gb free i have no almost filled this one up in a few months and have about 17gb free now i am starting to need the new sandisk 128gb i need money and storage i have been using it without any problems coming up my s4 treats it nice and i can get decent speeds of about 1015mbs transfer but i do hate waiting for a gb of 1080p footage to transfer but i guess i would rather have storage over speed i would recommend it to anyone needing high storage at a cheap price,5.0

broke after a couple of daysi bought this with costco black friday deal and started using just a couple of days ago today when i was transferring video files from my phone to the card i was not able to because it stopped half way now nothing can be written on itit was purchased from costco so it is not a fake microsdhc card i tested it out its authenticity with an application on google play and verified that it is real too still it is a piece junk what is sandisk doing to its reputationi would advise shopper to choose other brands over this surely it is cheap but would you rather lose all of the important files that you store in it,1.0
did i said fast no i mean super fast sandisk never disappoint for a 64gin microdisk this thing is super fast using it in my new galaxy note 2 amazing,5.0

updated great w galaxy s4 galaxy tab 4 101 no complaints here update 6192014 so my lovely wife bought me a samsung galaxy tab 4 for fathers day and i have been loving it ever since just as other with samsung products the galaxy tab 4 has the ability to add a microsd card to expand the memory on the device since it is been over a year i decided to do some more research to see if sandisk offered anything new as of 6192014 their product lineup for microsd cards from worst to best performancewise are the as followssandisksandisk ultrasandisk ultra plussandisk extremesandisk extreme plussandisk extreme pronow the difference between all of these cards are simply the speed in which you can readwrite data to the card yes the published rating of most all these cards except the sandisk regular are class 10uhsi but that is just a rating actual real world performance does get better with each model but with faster cards come more expensive prices since amazon does not carry the ultra plus model of microsd card i had to do direct comparisons between the sandisk ultra 3427 extreme 5795 and extreme plus 6795as mentioned in my earlier review i purchased the sandisk ultra for my galaxy s4 my question was did i want to pay over 20 more for a card that is faster than the one i already owned or i could pay almost double to get sandisks 2ndmost fastest microsd cardthe ultra works perfectly fine for my style of usage storingcapturing pictures hd video and movie playback on my phone so in the end i ended up just buying another sandisk ultra 64gb card i use my cell phone more than i do my tablet and if the card is good enough for my phone it is good enough for my tablet i do not own a 4k hd camera or anything like that so i honestly did not see a need to get one of the faster cards at this timei am now a proud owner of 2 sandisk ultra cards and have absolutely 0 issues with it in my samsung devices original review 512013 i have not had to buy a microsd card in a long time the last time i bought one was for my cell phone over 2 years ago but since my cellular contract was up i knew i would have to get a newer card in addition to my new phone the samsung galaxy s4 reason for this is because i knew my small 16gb microsd card was not going to cut itdoing research on the galaxy s4 i wanted to get the best card possible that had decent capacity 32 gb or greater this led me to find that the galaxy s4 supports the microsdxc class 10 uhsi card which is the fastest possible given that class searching for that specifically on amazon gave me results of only 3 vendors as of april that makes these microsdxc class 10 uhs1 cards they are sandisk the majority samsung and lexar nobody else makes these that are sold on amazonseeing how sandisk is a pretty good name out of the 3 i have used them the most i decided upon the sandisk because lexar was overpriced and the samsung one was overpriced as well as not eligible for amazon primebut the scary thing is that when you filter by the sandisk you literally get dozens of options all of them have different model numbers different sizes and so on then there is that confusion of whats the difference between sdhc sdxcsdhc vs sdxcsdhc stand for secure digital high capacity and sdxc stands for secure digital extended capacity essentially these two cards are the same with the exception that sdhc only supports capcities up to 32gb and is formated with the fat32 file system the sdxc cards are formatted with the exfat file system if you use an sdxc card in a device it must support that file system otherwise it may not be recognizable andor you have to reformat the card to fat32fat32 vs exfatthe differences between the two file systems means that fat32 has a maximum file size of 4gb limited by that file system exfat on the otherhand supports file sizes up to 2tb terabytes the only thing you need to know here really is that it is possible your device does not support exfat if that is the case just reformat it to fat32 remember formatting erases all datato clarify the model numbers i i hopped over to the sandisk official webpage what i found there is that they offer two highspeed options for sandisk cards these are sandisk extreme pro and sandisk ultra sandisk extreme pro is a line that supports read speeds up to 95mbsec however they are sdhc only to make things worse they are currently only available in 16gb 8gb capacities since one of my requirements was to have a lot of storage i ruled these outthe remaining devices listed on amazons search were the sandisk ultra line but here confusion sets in because sandisk separates these cards to two different devices cameras mobile devices is there a real difference between the two or is this just a marketing stunt unfortunately i am not sure but i do know the price difference between the two range from a couple cents to a few dollars since i was not sure i opted for the one specifically targeted for mobile devices just in case there is some kind of compatibility issue to find the exact model number i would go to sandisks webpage sandiskcom and compare their existing product lineup from there you get exact model numbers and you can then search amazon for these model numbers that is how i got mine sdsdqua064gas for speed tests i have not run any specific testing but copying 8 gb worth of data from my pc to the card literally took just a few minutesone last note is that amazon attaches additional characters to the end for example sdsdqua064gaffpa vs sdsdqua064gu46a the difference between the two is that the affpa means amazon frustration free packaging other than that these are exactly the same if youre wondering what i got and want to use it in your galaxy s4 i got the sdsdqua064gu46a and it works like charm,5.0
great for tabletsi inserted this little gem in to my new nook hd and let me tell youwow she loves it so much and she would not give it back instead of buying larger capacity tabletsjust buy the smallest amount of gigs and buy one of these little dudes,5.0

purchased for my go proi purchased this for my go pro hero 3 its a solid card but unless your planning to buy several i would recommended going with the 64 gig at the higher capture setting you can only get a little over an hour or so of video time,5.0
exceptional memorya standard when it comes to high capacity mobile memory grated if you have an older android phone or older tablet you probably would not see much difference but if you have a modern device like a galaxy s4 or note 3 or equivalent mobile device youll definitely notice the difference in data transfer and access in your device for modern phones a uhs1 memory card is a must the only reason i did not give this product five stars is because it is not a sandisk extreme or a sandisk extreme pro but then again you must have extremely specific needs to want to get 85mbs transfer speeds on a mobile device for movies music and applications this one is more that adequate,4.0

fast as fast currently gets in sdno question it is really as fast as it is rated how fast well class 10 sdhc means literally sd format hchigh capacity class 10 10mbsec readwrite how fast is 10mb per second well class 4 the most common step down that is cheaper is class 4 that is 4mbsec so class 10 is 25 times faster why pay the differencedigital cameras at some point the number of picturessec or hd video is bottlenecked by the speed of the media it is being recorded tosmart phones i have a samsung note ii a quadcore processor wizbang yaddayadda yes i do notice speed differences in camera application performance i use a spreadsheet applicationbrowsernetflixmusic streaming et al is noticeably faster where do you think the phone stores stuff to when it does not use the factory installed memory iphomes do not have an sd slot and i wouldnt own a phone or tablet that does not i believe in choice in the computer realmoh yeah sandisk is a leader and pioneer in the sd format where do you think the sd came from the only other sdhc class 10 card worthy of comparison is the samsung brand but then i might be biased on that one,5.0

cannot handle recording 108060p video on galaxy note 2i have to assume that the brand new 64gb sandisk ultra class 10 sdxc card is responsible for the occasional video recording stutterpausing that has happened since i started using it today prior to that never had an issue with my previous sandisk sdhc card but today on its maiden trip it has led each video only 35 minutes long each to have several performance issues that by default i have to attribute to the card since nothing else has changed and i have never had an issue in the four months that i have had my galaxy note 2 no problems formatting this card though or installingusing it otherwise,2.0

good addition to gopro gig bagthese cards worked flawlessly with the gopro hero 3 instead of opting for the bigger card i got two smaller cards to start with that way i could transfer data to my laptop while still using the other card if youre wanting to do an unassisted large record like a timelapse or something opting for the bigger card is smart but for my usage being able to swap back and forth was invaluableso far no hiccups or problems even with the faster more beefy shooting settings,4.0

hoorayi bought this because it was super cheap on black friday or cyber monday week whatever that means it is great i bought it thinking that it might be better in my galaxy s2 but i have not noticed any difference in speed i guess it is more for hd video recording or picture taking in a camera,5.0
great cardfirst off i got mine at walmart but i am considering the 64gb version as of now but the 16gb card i have is really fast i have actually transferred all i can to it from my galaxy si because for what ever reason it reads of the card faster than it does from the phones internal 16gb of memory i have always used snadisk stuff everything from flash drives sd cards and now even a ssd they make great stuff,5.0
adequate speedthis sd card used to be one of the fastest now it is merely adequatei bought the 64gb version and inserted into my samsung galaxy s5 latest samsung phonethe performance although still adequate is less than stellar for example to load the amazon kindle application which is about 35mb and i purposely placed it into this sd card it takes about 7 full seconds to load the same application on my ipad takes around 2 seconds to loadstill if you are not too much into your smartdevice performance then i wouldnt worry but if you do care about how fast your smartphone can take pictures assuming your pictures are stored in sd cards or how fast your applications will load then you should purchase a much faster sd card for your latest phonepros1adequate performance2hassle free packagingcons1not the fastest but still adequate,4.0

good resultsi use a sony camera with fairly high megapixels per picture i also tend to snap many shots in a row so the buffering speed of cards like this is important on a recent trip abroad during which i took 30 picturessometimes using the panorama functioni never ran into any processing delays the camera and card let me just keep snapping cards like this are noticed only if they do not perform they are otherwise just there which is a good thing this one seems to perform obviously not a technical evaluation just a laymans assessment after using this card for a while,5.0

reliable memoryi bought this extra memory for my samsung galaxy s4 i wish i had known when i bought my phone that android changed its memory management technique between gingerbread and jelly bean verizon sold me a 16gb samsung s4 i did not do much research since my old phone broke and i was about to leave on a business trip the next day come to find out there are 32 and 64gb versions of the galaxy s4 i never asked verizon if they even carried different versions well i figured that wouldnt be a problem i will just put in a 64gb micro sd tf card and i will be all set unfortunately you can no longer transfer applications to the micro sd card some applications can store data on the sd card but there is no longer the ability to move to sd since i travel internationally i use a lot of global positioning system mapping software and would like to download multiple gigs of map data for offline mapping as of now i can only download this to my phones 16gb memory and not to this 64gb memory card pictures except for burst photos videos and music can all be put on the 64gb sd card all that being said this memory card works well and is priced on par with all of the other comparable cards on the market if youve got the cash and need the space for music videosmovies andor picturesjust not applications then i recommend picking one of these up,5.0

the ultimate smartphone upgradeit is a giant fast microsd card for your phone it works and it is reasonably priced i have swapped this card through the past 3 phones i have owned and it continues to serve me well on the road you can bring along enough 1080p movies for a 20 hour flight or several of them and still have plenty of room left overthe only downside is that it is not even more capacity but really 64gb is probably overkill,5.0

works great in a samsung galaxy s3i bought this memory card specifically to add extra storage on my samsung galaxy s3 it was very easy to install in the phone and it recognized the card instantly i turned the phone off before i removed the back cover and installed the card i am not sure if this is needed but i figured it wouldnt hurt by doing it that way after it was installed and recognized i formatted the card through the phone options the card is very fast when writing to it or reading from iti would definitely recommend this card to others especially if you have a galaxy s3 and want some more storage space on it,5.0
never settler for class 4when you buy a micro sd card and you get a class 4 your applications will run slow and your camera will be slow spend the money on a class 10 for the speed of the card to ensure your device works up to its full potential listen to me i am a certified geek,5.0

more than enough storagei bought this card to go with my new samsung galaxy note 101 2014 edition after using it for a few days with only the onboard storage i felt the need to have a little more space the price for this card was just right and i have always had great success with sandisk memory devices whether they are usb or sd or what have you i use this card to take all sorts of music and movies with me whenever i have to go anywhere and there is absolutely no lag or hiccuping on playback i also set this card as the default to store photos and videos taken with the tablet and there is no noticeable delay when taking photos this card works so well i just bought a second one to replace an old 8gb card in my phone,5.0
fast and reliablethis works well in my galaxy s4 i use it for media storage i did have to reseat it once as i kept getting an error about preparing sd card but i think that was more about how i put it in my phone than about this media i think that this is a pretty good value to extend storage on a phoneupdate i deducted a star because this card has a capacity of 32 billion bytes but not 32 gb there is a difference the storage is actually around 29 gb because 320 1024 1024 1024 298 gb it is still a very good value and i would still recommend it highly but do understand that you are not getting 32 gb,4.0

it worksthis was purchased for my cell phone it was easy to plugged in and my phone recognized it instantlythe adaptor that comes with the device i had some problems with the adaptor has a write protection switch that both my toshiba and horsepower laptops like to turn on while inserting it into the sd slot to get around this i have to insert this adaptor at a slight angle and apply a little pressure to try and not let that switch get changed on insertion it works but it is a pain fortunately since the chip is in my phone 99 of the time it is not a pain i deal with too often it is something that may need to be considered though if you plan on using this device primarily in the standard sized sd slot of a laptop or computer,4.0

good flash cardi had bought this card for my new samsung galaxy s3 the card is about as good as you can expect for the price and technology youre paying forsdxc cards come formatted in exfat by default which is what i would have tried to format it as anyway and seen if my phone supports that filesystem in addition to being a faster format enabling higher transfer rates exfat also takes up less storage space than say an fat or fat32 filesystem would which is important when considering mobile storage devicesi read several poor reviews about this product starting that it simply stopped working after a few months while that can happen from regular use as it has happened to me in the past with a couple 32gb sdhcs i would venture to say it was an error in use flash media is very sensitive in regards to hard shutdowns that is to say just pulling it out of your device or card reader without first unmounting it within the data storage menu on android phones there is an option to unmount sd card i would recommend that you always select this before removing any external memory card to avoid corruption of data and ultimately the card itself the reason for this is that sudden stoppage of a flash memory devices data or power connectivity can easily result in corruptiontransversely if you have the memory card plugged into a card reader say with an sd adapter you should first eject the card in windows there is a small icon located in the taskbar notification menu for safely removing hardware and ejecting media select the card and a notification will popup that the card is now safe to remove it basically severs the same function as the android unmount optional but will also cease any current readwrite operations to avoid data or device corruptioni cannot speak for how one would do this on a mac os but chances are if youre using an apple pc you do not have an android phone,5.0

no complaintsi had an htc evo design 4g and i added this card to it it was like 4x faster to transfer files to it from a computer and games like andova 2 which put a massive amount of files on your microsd loads so much faster i put all my applications on my sd and noticed no difference in performance of the games or applicationsi had one problem though and it was that my phone would repeatedly say that the card was unmounted or it could not find the card popping of the battery cover and pulling out the card and reinserting would fix this or just a reboot i thought this was the fault of the card but since i have upgraded to an htc evo 4g lte i have had no issues with the cardso if you have issues with your phone not reading the card it might be your phone,5.0
work great with high def action and video camsthis is the minimum speed class you want for video recording there are faster ones but this does the job and the value is good make sure to check and see if the camera you are putting this in can take a card of this capacity seems odd but some do not use a card of more than 32gb so check first also check web sites for firmware updates many cameras did not take these at first but do now what more can you say about a commodity like memory get it and store stuff like crazy to be fair at 1080p this will hold an insane amount of video and images more than you are likely to shoot on a 2 week trip but you can always use the extra space as storage and maybe this format will work in your new 4k camera you will need 65gb then for sure,5.0

junk does not work in droid bionic with icsi have exclusively used sandisk extreme cards in my pro photography gear for years and they have never let me down this one is a dud though i plugged it in let my phone format it and then start copying to it everything copied just fine but after i got done that is when it started acting upif i had my phone plugged into the computer and was using it as a storage device i got tons of crc errors andor messages saying that i needed to format the card before using it the phone would come up from time to time saying that i had inserted a blank card if i reboot the phone it works fine for a little bit and the errors would start again i thought maybe it was the way the phone formatted so i tried to format it on the computer but that did not help anythingvery frustrating thankfully i have had it for 2 days before the trouble started so it is going back to amazon for a refund and i will have to find a more reliable card for my phone,1.0
died after 2 monthsthe card worked great at first i have never had a problem with sandisk in the past but i bought this card for my galaxy s3 back in october and it was dead by december i am sorely disappointed by this purchase maybe it is just a faulty card but my experience was terrible so this gets one star,1.0
shame on menever looked to verify the capacity of this card it is clearly labeled 64gb but when installed it clearly is not when installed into any computer it shows 274gb available with 168 used so beware if you order one to make sure you are getting what you pay for,1.0

sandisk ultra 64gb micro sdxc cardafter having my first ever failure of a sd card a 32gb sandisk micro sd card that went from apparently fine to totally corrupted in a matter of minutes and before i could salvage anything on it with the refund from amazon of the 32 gb card i purchased this 64gb ultra card as the replacement for my phoneafter having problems getting the full 64 gb seen as an individual 64 gb and not a partitioned into two 32 gb files on the card and the secret is to not format the card in a computer format the card in the phone then via usb or wifi you can add back all the contentit is seemingly working great seems fast with no undo lag when taking burst mode photos and i just hope it will continue to do so i am much more contentious about backing up though with android amazon and google pretty much all your content can be saved online and reinstalled but it takes time and is a big hassle so just backing up to a computer works great for the next just in case time,4.0

speeds are a little misleading nowhere near 30 mbs on write speedseven though it says my review is for the 32gb version it is for the 64gb not sure why it says 32gb abovei received this card to use in my 2013 macbook air for extra storage i liked that the speeds were up to 30 mbs i figured there would be a little bit of a fudge factor but not this muchwhile i can consistently get almost 45 mbs read speeds the write speeds were only around 105 mbsi guess you could average these together but i do not think that is really the point i did not see a review that dealt with this specifically so hopefully this will help someone else out in the futureupdate only now did i go back and read the tiny print that write speeds may be slower well that is obvious now but i think 14 of the speed is a lot slower,3.0

sandisk ultra 64 gb microsdxc class 10 uhs1 memory card 30mbs withalways can trust sandisk for my memory card needs this purchase was because i was considering getting a samsung galaxy s3 phone which only has 16gb memory but has an internal slot for memory expansion however just had several bad experiences with 3 samsung printers at work all of them broke down within a couple of weeks of each other for various reasons and to get repair and replacement parts is ridiculously expensive cheaper for me to go and buy a new printer samsung website is 1500 useless and tech support is even less knowledgeable than my 4 year old nephew spoke to a good friend who works for att who has both s3 and iphone 5 and he said dont get the s3 so i upgraded to an 64gb iphone 5so this memory card has gone to my son for his galaxy s3so sorry about the rant but i hate samsung,5.0
sandisk 64gb microsdxcarrived today as always shipping from amazon is the besti read the reviews and decided i would give the sandisk 64gb microsdxc a shot normally i go with patriot for all my flash memoryso one thing i read that worried me was the heat issue well i can say that it does run hothow hot you ask i can feel it through the back cover of my samsung galaxy s3 not plastic melting hot but i know it is thereis that an issue maybe maybe not i have never really noticed any of my previous cards getting hot sure even some of my usb sticks run hot after a transferis it cause for concern i honestly do not know yeti will use it and see if heat causes any issues if anyone has had the same problem feel free to comment and tell me what happened or if you contacted sandiski am thinking about calling them and also samsung to find out what max temperature range is acceptable as i really do not want to ruin my bada new phoneotherwise this is a lot of space for cheap cannot complain there i gave it 5 stars for that reason alonethe heat issue is something else and i wont take a star off just because of thatbut i will still be concerned until i have some answersthanks for reading,5.0
greatgreat price and holds tons of stuff the class 10 is way faster then any other card i have purchased,5.0
does not work well with gopro hero 3 black editiondespite the class 10 rating this card has much slower write speeds than some others and there are numerous examples online of it not being fast enough to work with the high resolution video from the gopro hero 3 black edition if youre using that camera choose one of the cards recommended on their site,1.0

multiple usesi bought this card for my galaxy s4 but with the included adapter i can also use it in my canon 6d in a pinch as it meets uhs1 spec it can keep up with the cameras bufferthere are plenty of details in these reviews regarding transfer rates and so on so i would not revisit that i have had no issues with the card overheating it performs exactly as i expected the price was also fantastici would recommend this card to anyone for a wide variety of reasons it is fast has a good warranty and comes with the adapter to use in regular sized sd card slots,5.0
could not beat the pricepicked this up for my sport action camera and it is just what i needed class 10 and the speeds match up with the rating came with a sd card adapter which was a nice bonus been using it for almost 2 months now with formatting after each filming no lag on any of the video no problems with card running strong,5.0
file size restrictionsi could not put any files onto the card that were 5 gb a little disappointing since i wanted to store movies on it but i guess it is a limitation of the microsd hc technology,4.0

do not buy this product edited 031213i purchased this product a few months back as a replacement for another 32gb sandisk memory card that was not even a year old that ceased to work after using this memory card for a few months i started having the same problem where the card randomly stops working or is not even recognized by my galaxy s3 phone i tried plugging it into my computer with the provided adapter and it seldom gets recognized this card is not worth the money for it will not last buy pny or any other brand sandisk has lost a customer03122013 amazoncom rocks they refunded the full amount of the purchase kudos to them,3.0

great memory card for the pricei use this memory card for my tablet that has many pictures and games and also my music one can not go wrong with lots of music and this memory card really helps me keep it all,5.0
it does work with htc evo 4g ltei was a bit skeptical about getting this card because the official instructions for this phone only mention that the external memory is expandable up to 32gb i did a bit of research before purchasing many reported being able to use this card with the evo 4g lte i can confirm that it worksat first the phone would not recognize the card you need to format the card when you first install it once you format the card the phone will recognize it you can write read data with no issuesi got such a large card because of music i wanted to add music in wav format for better audio quality or at least in mp3 320kbs i am very happy with this card,5.0

an excellent memory card for the moneyok this would not be a technical review or a rating of measured speeds it is simply a review from a consumer point of view i have bought a couple of these microsdxc memory cards for tablets and have seen no lag in saving data i also use them for digital cameras and have been very happy with the record time it is instant you can get into the mbs on various cards but usually the difference is not something that anyone would notice or see for the price this is an excellent memory card and i would highly recommend it,5.0
some of these just die on you i was using mine in a gopro hero 3 the card just broke for no reason there is controversy weather its the gopro or sandisk but after doing some google research it seems that its more of sandisks fault as these sd cards also fail or used to in varies samsung devices phones tablets amazon sent me a replacement so no harm done but for the money you would expect something top notchgopro users on the support forums recommend getting 2x32gb sd cards which have not had any issues as far as anyone knows the worst part is losing important content i was lucky i copied my movies from the sd card onto a hd on my pc others not so lucky,1.0
five starsdoes as it is supposed to,5.0

second orderthis is the second time i have purched this sandisk card i have one in my note 3 and now one in my new galaxy note pro 122 i really wanted the 128gb for my pro but the price was too high for me to justify spending around 120 when this one is currently around 43 i hope the price drops soon on the 128gb this was simple to install and did not require formatting on either device just plug and save it was that easy,5.0
64 gb cardworks great and price was not too bad either worked perfect with out having to format it transfer rate was fast when i loaded 20 movies and 9 gb of musice and 2 gb of pictures all at the same time it took a total of 30 min probably because i had multiple transfers at same time but works great for my new bought samsung galaxy note 101 thanks,5.0
got this for my s4its way faster than i expected brings plenty of storage for very a cheap price i can fully recommend this item,5.0
nice cardworks perfectly on my gopro camera silver edition hd 3 been in use for about three months with no problems highly recommend,5.0
works without issuememory is typically a gono go kind of deal speeds can also be a factor but in reality i have nothing to really challenge the speed claims of this memory so that is a moot point,5.0
do not use in your goproi purchased this for my gopro hero 3 and it worked ok for a while then suddenly the camera would only record about 10 seconds at a time after reading some forums online i was prompted to swap this sandisk out for a samsung card all of my problems went away i still use this card for random storage but i would not use it in a camera again,1.0
does a good jobdoes a good job at a nice price i like this it came on time and fits well in my dell venue pro,5.0
best accessory for my galaxy note iiwith this card i picked up for 35 amazons black friday sale i increased my gniis storage to 80gb it transfers data at about 15mb readwrite which is well below advertised however this is very similar to the speed that my gniis built in storage transfers data at so when running large applications off of this sd card i see no difference in speed than running applications off of the phone itself,4.0
works as expectednothing interesting to write it works just fine and holds a lot of info for such a little card thanks,5.0

perfect companion for both my galaxy s3 and s4i had been using a regular sandisk 32gb micro sd card that came included with my htc thunderbolt i bought in 2011 the size was decent but i never realized until upgrading how much i was lacking on the speedi finally got one of these to replace my old card with my galaxy s3 it is superb i just recently got a galaxy s4 and again this card is just about the best expansion you can add to most any phonewith my old microsd card i had gotten used to just sitting there zoning out as i waited patiently for my computer to transfer picturesvideos off my card to be backedup to my pcs hard drive or copying some music files from my pc to my card with this new card almost any single file even hundreds of megabytes big is an instant transfer that transfers too quick to even bring up that moving dialog box in windows 8 on my very big transfers lots of hd video files at once totaling several gigabytes i have to wait but i am waiting for seconds instead of minutescombine the excellent speed with the fact that 64gb can hold a ton of data compared to typical storage sizes on phones and you have a very satisfied customer now i can procrastinate even longer the occasional transfers of all my pictures and videos to my pc though i try not toa lot of phones like my s4 specify 64gb sdxc cards as the maximum they support so this is about the best you can even get for the moment unless you want to pay almost double for sandisks extreme cards unless you have money to burn i think these are a much better value and diminishing returns certainly kick in beyond this price point but perhaps my next phone will support 4k hd video onto 256gb cards and i will yet again need to upgrade my cards capacity and speed anyway bottom line on this product awesome,5.0
great cardbought this a few months back for my phone but after switching phones to one that did not support extra storage i reformatted and stuck it on my car stereo full of music even at full capacity it has been there for months now playing without a hitch music only take about 5 seconds after starting the car to start playing skipping fast forwarding or searching all works flawlessly the stereo is to be given some props here but if the card was not up to par it clearly wouldnt be as fast as it is very glad with the purchase will buy again if the need ever comes,5.0
fastwith technology improving upon solid state memory extremely quickly there is no excuse to buy the best in speed without sacrificing qualitymany 32gb cards are class 24 which makes them very slow if youre going to be utilizing 32gb of data for photosvideos your phone or just super small storage youre much better off purchasing a faster card such as this the price is right and even if it is a little more expensive than the class 24 or even 6s you will regret having pinched a few dollars instead of investing into faster speedsi currently use this in my sony action cam and the write speed works perfectly for me as well as the reading speed to transfer files off the card,5.0
nook to androidi used this to turn my nook color into an android it was incredibly easy to install and works great i have not had any problems with it the read and write speeds are phenomenal given that i am running an entire operating system off just this card the price was great too,5.0

great memory cardi have come to trust the sandisk brand for file storage and was not disappointed with this card it has held up to months of constant file writing and rewriting with use in a dash cam that loop records i recommend this card to anyone,5.0
works for me in my camerasi ended up with two of these after mistakenly purchasing the regular sized sd cards for hikvision security cameras only to find that they needed the micro sd cards instead they installed and formatted with no issues and are working well in the camerasthe best thing about sandisk is that they have a lifetime warranty with these cards unlike some of the other brandsi purchased these for 45 dollars each and are reasonably priced around that,5.0
works great with a gopro 3 blacki bought this class 10 sd card for my gopro 3 black and it works great i only recorded with 1080p 60fps with protunes and never had any problems in the past in my gopro hero2 it was very picky with the sd card that you use but so far this card works great i do not trust the transfer speed test because there are so many factors that change the outcome card reader usb version hard drives and and so on,5.0
worked great for mei use this in my dell venue 8 tablet i have loaded it up with movies mp4s and they playback flawlessly however if it try to add a very large movie 4gb my windows 7 machine says that it is too large for the destination format i shrink them down when that happens again i am very happy with this purchase just wanted to point out a small limitation,5.0

great productdoes what it suppose to doworks great works well good price would buy another good storage for any digital file,5.0
works just as describedgood product it arrived extremely fast and performs just as described it was considerably cheaper than any other store i found i specially like the speed of this sd card however do keep in mind that the speeds tend to be exaggerated the speeds are way faster than normal sd card speeds and you will notice it but not anywhere close to whats advertised there a lot of factor that go in to consideration when it comes to the advertised speed this is not the manufacture or seller fault but it depends on the system that is being used,4.0

my galaxy s3 loves iti bought this with the sole intention of putting it in my samsung galaxy s3 i had to use a tool to format the card to fat32 but once i did so the card worked great i have been taking advantage of the extra room i have for music videos pictures and so on the sd adapter that comes with this is also handythe transfer speeds did not feel like class 10 when connected and transferred files from my computer but my computer is 5 years old so it is very possible that it is the problem other than that i am completely satisfied,5.0
finally a class 10 that works for micro sda lot of the other class 10 micro sd cards that came out seemed to have issues after a year of usage this one works great in my galaxy s3 i also like the color on the card so much better than just black so stylish except it is hiding inside the back of my phone maybe i should make a clear window just where the micro sd card is so everyone knows i am using the sandisk ultra class 10 hmm,5.0

works very wellworks well came with an sd adapter and i am using it in a portable video camera captures everything even 1080p at 30 fps just fine no rate issues,5.0
not as fast as it advertised buti tested it in several uhs1 compliant devices and found the write speed at 12 mbytesecond sounds fine for a class 10 card but this is not what i was paying for i do not expect it to run anywhere close to uhs1 interface speed 104 mbs but it should be close to 30 mbs as the manufacturer advertised i have a lot more choices if i am only looking for a class 10 cardindeed microsd cards are usually slower than fullsize sd card they use the same flash controller so the reason is really microsd cards use slower nand flash manufacturers know you are not going to use microsd cards in highspeed slrs so they get to sell you lower quality nand at a premium my advice to you the photography enthusiasts is to buy fullsize sd cards rather than microsd cards with adaptorsthat said the compatibility is great it works great with my tablets pcs gpss and phones that is what i like about sandisk they do thorough compatibility tests before product release,4.0

great product at great price read the fine printi hate how people complain the transfer speed is not the promised 30mbs it even says in the fine print that it depends on the product you are using the card on i bought this to upgrade my galaxy note 2s memory bought on sale for about 20 and amazon credited me the difference when it went on sale a week later for 17 very satisfied great product and great customer service thanks amazon,5.0

massive storage for a good pricethere really is not a whole lot to say about this the amount of storage space is fantasticthere are options for using this on older devices that do not necessarily support microsdxc formats windows by default will only allow you to format the card as exfat or ntfs these formats will work for most new devices but some may have issueif you use fat32 as the filesystem instead you can use this card for older devices and it still works great with android i have been using this card on my old sandisk sansa fuze running rockbox and it works great i was not expecting that but i am very happy with it,5.0

works fine the gopro but is almost too small to handle in the fieldcompactflash is just about perfect to use in a camera in the field as the size shrinks so does ones ability to easily handle the card sd is getting marginal as far as usability in the field forget about changing a micro sdhc card unless you are back at your computer too small to handle and easy to drop and loosehowever with the 32gb and 64gb cards that is not quite an issue especially if you leave the card in the camera the camera is larger than the card my a great deal set it down and it is a lot easier to find and handle than a micro card shown twice as large as life when i was writing this reviewmy cards came with sd adaptors so that they would be useable in my work flow a plus also within the adaptor i can use the card in devices with sd slots and download using my existing readers,4.0

good cardi purchased the card in the sandisk packaging so i am pretty sure it is genuine i tested it with various programs on the web that apparently can detect whether they are fakes or not this one turned out to be a real sandisk card the card came formatted with fat32i read on the web about these micro sds and apparently they are not as fast as the full sd card version i borrowed my brothers sandisk 32gb full sd card to make comparison tests here are my officialunofficial test results using diskbench v2620 and h2testw 14 test i will give the results as an overall result because after testing these cards over and over with speed writes and reads the results get mixed and varied to a big degree much larger than i expected but the numerous tests showed me a general trend the trend is that the full sd cards do write faster than the microsd card but also remember that the microsd had to be put into an adapter to do the test on my pc while the fullsd card was put into the computer reader directlythese are just my averages butsmall file writesboth sd cards wrote at close to 10mbsec the microsd was less consistent in the tests and sometimes dropped to 8mbsecsmall file readsboth sd cards read at close to 20 mbsec at their fastestlarge file copies to cardmicrosd wrote at 35mbsec while the fullsd wrote at about 4mbseclarge file reads copies from cardmicrosd was 10mbsec while the fullsd read at about 14mbsecmy conclusionmy tests were by no means official for this card and showed much variance dependent on file size of the reads and writes but the fullsd card was faster in many cases but equal to microsd in most cases the small file writes and reads showed that they are similar enough but my only concern is with large file writes is 35 mbsec good enough for rapid photography on a high pixel camera i do not know i have had no problem using these cards with h264 movie capture for hours i am surprised that 35 mbsec is enoughalso never during the huge file copies to the card did i get any noticeable heating of the card itself by touch even for an hour i have noticed that it has been a complaint from many people on the web some stating that they felt they might burn themselves i copied files that took more than an hour with no noticeable temperature change other than perhaps a couple of degrees of course this was on a pc and not installed in a camerathe card performs well for video work and appears to meet many other tests performed by other people i never saw a read close to 30 mbsec they were very consistent at 20 mbsec at the highest performancei would get the card again if the price were right,4.0
greatnot much to say about this but it was definitely worth the buy it comes w a small case to hold both itself and the adapter for just over 10 you really cannot go wrong,5.0

sandisk ultra 32 gb microsdhc c10uhs1 memory card with adapterwhen the price is right on these these memory cards why not buy for it a late model tablet i could also make this a review for class 4 kingston 32 gb microsdhc which i bought from amazon at the same time the class 10 cards will work in the late model tablets while there might be a small speed boost in booting up and having the tablet ready to run compared to a class 6 or a lower class card i would say it there just is not that huge of difference between this and lower speed cards i would say it is what inside the tablet that will determine it is bootup speed more than the card you put into it in different devices such as cameras that can use this type of card this may very well not be true but brand name and cost are the determining factors for what i buy to put in my tablets,4.0

after 6 months of using this card nothing but errorsexpensive junki bought this card originally for my galaxy note ii with the intentions of using it as my primary downloader but i could not get it to format correctly for the phone even using third party format softwarei then tried it in my galaxy tab2 70plussame problemsi finally and ridiculously put the card in my nikon d5100 camera i could take a whopping 8k photos on highlarge settings not that i would ever need to take that many photos in one session this was the last option i had to use the cardit worked well taking photos of a holiday and thankfully it did not fail before i could get my photos onto a computer since then i have inserted it back in the camera and reformatted like you always should and bam one photo is good after that failure every single time so now i have a 64gb card that is capable of taking and storing one photo at a time before i must run a fix file system on my computerdo not waste your money on this card over priced not really faster than the other cards i have and zero longevity this may be a one off but i think it is a problem created by the proprietary format exfat that makes this card a loser or more to the point the poor customer who buys itupdate july 2012after contacting sandisk they have offered an rma but first they must verify that i have not tried to recover or wipe the data on the card and i must ship it at my expense to taiwan i have since emailed them in reply to the requested information date of purchase photos of the card packaging ect and i told them that the data on their is my data and if i could have accessed the card i would have wiped it why should i give them my information stored on the card that makes me less than happy i am guessing that they want to discourage returns who would want to send data to a company not knowing who will access it and what they will do with the information contained i would have wiped the card but it was unreadable unable to format unable to do anything i will send it to them hoping that the information is destroyed along with the bad cardsandisk you are asking a whole lot of your customers and since this card has gone bad i have had several other cards from them go bad as well seems to be a whole lot of cards being shipped that die in very short time periods i used to love their products and their older flash drives are great still using a micro cruzer that is 6 years old and going strong i have not had one single microsd card from this company last more than three months since i moved to the philippines either they send their junk to the philippines or they have dropped qc from their business model to create higher profit marginsupdate 2after emailing sandisk and expressing my displeasure with having to return the item intact so that they can assess the card and look atrecover what ever personal information may have been stored on the card they rescinded i can only assume that they want to get the card back to verify that it is bad or make sure that you are not just trying to get a free card out of them which i can understand instead of requiring me to send the card back to them they asked that i cut the card and send a photo of the destroyed card so they could process a new card to be sent to me directly in the philippines i hammered them pretty hard in this review and in the email i sent to them regarding the bad card and sometimes you get results in this case i give them 5 stars for doing the right thing i had no problem cutting the card since it would not operate in any of my devices anyway but i did have a problem returning the device intact with out knowing what information was stored on the card banking amazon account info passwords ect i would have just kept the card destroyed it and never bought another from sandisk with their faith restoring gesture i will not remove them from my list of companies to avoid i just hope that they get better at qc i returned another defective card to the retailer yesterday only to find out that you must have the original packaging for a replacement i was lucky to still have one of my packages but since i bought several of the cards i am not sure if i gave them the matching package for the card i returnedi would suggest that if you are like me and have several devices 2 dslrs galaxy tab2 galaxy note 2 sii lgp920 that you find a way to mark each cardpackage and keep the package in the case that the card should go bad i have had more than half of my sandisk 32gb cards fail on me in less than 6 months i only buy them because of the cards available in my area these are the best which is scary with such a high failure rate,1.0

sandisk the best availablei bought this memory card because of the sandisk reputation and the class 10 speed i use this for my samsung galaxy tablet the class 10 speed is really impressive the memory card can write to memory pictures as fast as you can take them loading music is almost instantaneous and a 5 minute music video loads in about 4 seconds i highly recommend this for any tablet or smartphone with expandable memory class 10 speed with sandisk reliability worth every penny,5.0
the usual results half advertised speedin reallife usecopying compressed files to and from the cardit clocks in at barely over half the advertised speeds about 16mbs read and about 75mbs write as averaged between testing on several sd slots some usbconnected some pcieconnected on several computers plus a justreleased smartphone very unimpressed by the up to marketing of sd card vendors and makersthe actual raw size is also about 595gb which i find fascinating for a flash device which is only ever manufactured with powersoftwo components 1kb 1024b,2.0

similar to the other 492 users worked great for about 2 monthsupdatethis card stopped working as of late february 2013 after only about 2 months of regular use there are 492 similar complaints about this card now 493 and this is 175 of 1 star out of 2918 reviews at first i thought it was my phone not being able to find it or the card would often spontaneously dismount and there were the frequent and repeated alerts for me to format the card formatting the card only cured the problem for a day or two plugged it into the desktop directly and the same thing happened got another card of another brand and everything has been working well since early march 2013 with the other card so it was not the phone but the card that is at fault very poor longevity the price is right but at the end not worth it if you need to buy another card to replace it amazon only covers 30 days so consider this a very expensive 60 day experiment if you are willing to try this brand of card would not recommend,1.0

performance is not class 10sandisk makes a lot of claims about this card and some of them are questionable i own two and while the highcapacitylowprice certainly makes them useful they are not the answer to all of my recording needs first of all do not use this with a gopro hero 3 or later model despite sandisks claims these cards cannot handle the demands of true hd recording gopro removed it from their list of recommended cards because it caused the cameras to lock up and turn off even with mycanon vixia hf10 flash memory high definition camcordertechnology which is over 10 years oldthe sandisk ultra card does not meet the requirements for shooting in fxp mode 1920x1080 17mbps even though the camera says only a class 4 is required a firmware update to the gopro fixed the issue for hero 3 and hero 3 cameras but it did so by throttling the recording speed for the cards that is lowering the quality of the recording slightlythose shortcomings aside the sandisk ultra can shoot in xp mode 1440 x 1080 on the vixia hf10 and it works with all of the settings of acontourroam waterproof hd 1080p is it waterproof temperature proof xray proof shock proof i cannot say the contourroam is a waterproof camera so even nonwaterproof cards are safe for submersion if they are in the housing the ultra has functioned in 10 weather and after being dropped so there is validity to the claim of it being temperature and shockproof i guess i will find out whether it is xrayproof the next time i go through the airport,3.0

great product that worksworks flawlessly in my note 101 2014 edition you get a about 625gb usable storagethe only thing i have noticed and to be fair it is most likely the tablet or the application is a stutter when watching hd movies either downloaded fro google play or samsung hub i had to use the free gift cards that came with the tablet for somethingi have not noticed any real lag or stutter when using the camera application3495 seems to be a fair price these were about 10 earlier this year,5.0

gb storage a little shortmy sd card showed only a little more than 29 gb available for my 32 gb card that is the bare minimum i will accept without sending it back i am normally happy with the brand name sd cards i buy on amazon though for the price i paid for this particular card my expectations were higher,3.0
gold standard for latest android devices i got my wife a samsung galaxy tab 3 101 for christmas and it took awhile for her to start figuring out all the things it can do once she did that led of course to her wanting to watch movies on it that was my signal to spring into action that is if i wanted to prevent her from running wild buying digital copies of every movie we already have in dvd or bluray you cannot play dvd or bluray movies on this device but you can use your computers dvd or bluray drive and commonplace thirdparty software to convert movies in this format into mp4 andor several other types of video files that can be played on this tabletsince this particular tablet is capable of playing highdefinition video screen resolution is 1280 x 800 pixels and we want to use all of that highdef capability my conversion files tend to be pretty large average 5 to 10gb per movie way too big to be stored on the tablets limited internal memory that is where the tablets microsd slot and this sandisk flash memory comes in i make huge mp4s store them separately on a 15 terabyte drive and then load as many of them as i can on this chip which shows up in the tablet as a separate memory source then all you have to do is pull up one of the movie files from the card and hit play you can use the devices standard video player or get an application with more controlswatching highdef video on a tablet that is streaming the data from a memory card rather than the tablets internal memory requires a memory card with very high read speed and this sandisk cards class 10 rating fills that bill that is the difference between cheaper microsd that is primarily designed for simple data storage and microsd that is designed for higher active transferread speeds the class 10 designation generally means that the subject card will transfer data at a minimum rate of 10mb per second this sandisk ultra card is capable of transferring data at speeds of up to 30mb per second depending on the speed of the device youre using it in and other particulars of the way youre using the devicefrustration free packaging means the chip sd adapter and plastic case comes in a little sealed cardboard envelope with a pull tab opener this card comes preformatted for android and my use of it in the galaxy tab 3 for watching highdef mp4 movies has thus far been flawlessfinally do not let yourself get burned by counterfeiters in trying to save a buck while pricing on memory tends to fluctuate amazons current pricing on this card is very competitive with anyall vendors out there selling genuine sandisk ultra memory buy from amazon or other trustworthy vendor because i just learned the hard way that these memory cards are being counterfeited in huge numbers that is the counterfeiters are placing sandisk labelingpackaging on inferior generic microsd and selling the bogus chips on ebay and anywhere else they can i bought three from amazon after i got burned by a chinese seller on ebay the counterfeit packaging and labeling was good enough to fool me until i actually tried one of the chips in the galaxy tab 3 the write speed that is the amount of time it takes to transfer files onto the microsd card was dramatically worse than the speed of a genuine sandisk ultra card and the read speed was totally inadequate for playing movies on the galaxy tab 3 i may never have figured it out at all if i did not already have one other genuine sandisk ultra with which to compare the fakesif you want the best most reliable memory for the microsd slot on your shiny new android device look no further this is it,5.0

sd card errors made this card useless after minimal usethis card had rave reviews so i decided to get it to use it with my new gopro hero3 camera i liked that it had a high capacity and it was class 10 which would allow me to maximize the features of my camera as soon as it arrived i popped it in to the camera for a quick test run and after it was successful i then packed it in my luggage for a snorkeling trip 3 days into taking awesome footage with my camera this sd card started resulting in sd card errors which made my data unrecoverable fortunately i still had some time in my trip to go get a different memory card with better reliability these memory cards appear to be hit or miss and in my case it was a miss i can not recommend this card for purchase it appears that this company has a problem with the quality control process and you can see that reviews are either overwhelmingly positive or as is my case 1 starnegative it looks as though they just accept a certain amount of faulty memory cards unfortunately for me i missed the window to return this card because i was travelling and i am stuck with a useless micro sd card i have had better luck with kingston and transcend brands lexar and samsung have also served me well in the past i will no longer purchase any other sandisk products and i wouldnt recommend that you would either but if your are swayed by the reviews make sure you thoroughly test what you purchase before you actually need it,1.0

they fail after a few monthswe ordered these and used them in my galaxy note 2 and my wifes razr m after a few months we noticed that they would cause the phone to freeze up the phones would start showing that it was mounting and unmounting the sd card early on but toward the end they just froze up the phone once we trashed the cards the phones worked fine we bought a different brand and no trouble since i do not know why these red gray ones have issues but stay away from them,1.0

worked for 2 months then stoppedif you look through the reviews you will see that this card seems to have both a failure rate and a incompatibility with some devices i bought this card in november of 2012 and it worked great for a while the card started failing in my galaxy note 2 in the beginning of january after reformatting and trying the card in other devices it still does not work please understand that this is not a user error but appear to be something wrong with the card itself i have tried the card in 3 different phones 1 with stock jelly bean 1 with that is cream sandwich and 1 with a cyanogenmod custom firmware all 3 devices have problems and say blank sd card or unsupported filesystem even formatting the card in both windows and using android do not seem to fix the issue i was happy to find such a good price on a large microsd card but sadly it looks like you get what you pay for it does appear that some people are having luck so it might be worth a gamble of 20 if you are feeling lucky if you do buy this card it would be wise to double check your backup process to make sure you do not lose pictures or videos if you have this problem i am glad i used dropbox for my phone so i did not lose any pictures or videos,1.0

perfecti do not know why i bought this but i am glad i did 32gb would of been just as good i bought this considering i have a huge itunes collection of about 28gb and would increase pass the 32gb so i bought the 64 problem is since i have a playstation plus account i bought a sony music unlimited at a reduced price of 12 bucks which left me having pretty much my entire music catalog in the palm of my hard without me wasting a single gb of memory i still love the product and does work would definitely recommend,5.0
does the job quite wellnot a bad product at all i got it for my blackberry z10 i had to format it through the phones software but afterwards it worked like a charm a couple months on and no problems class 10 and 64 gig so i have no complaints only reason i did not give 5 stars is because it is not particularly outstanding in any way but it is a pretty simple product does the job no problems good to go,4.0

quality varies wildlyi bought two of these at different times both of them had the retail packaging with the android on them and the model number matched the packagingthe first one was 32gb i tested this out with dd on my builtin sd card reader on my mbp and on a gfr204sd usb device and could not get more than 8 mbs average write speed would bounce up and down between 6 and 10 the class speed is supposed to be the minimum not the maximum rw off the hdd was above 20 so that was not the bottleneck neither is uhs compliant but i should at least be able to get the class 10 rating out of this read 30 mbs is pretty accuratethe second one 64gb i tested by just watching activity monitor to see if it was in the ballpark bounced between 8 and 10 copying from a hard drive or a ram disk sounds like probably class 10 read speed to ram disk was about 24 mbs,3.0

does not play nice with my galaxy s3i do not know if the gs3s have issues with reading cards of this size but i eventually had to remove this card and purchase a transcend 8gb class 10 card just to check if it was my phone that was the problem when i got it i opened the packet and popped it right in recognized was able to start using taking shots and video and they immediately saved to the card without the hangup my old class 2 card used to have after a couple of days i noticed that i would take a shot and the phone would give me an error that it could not save to the sd card you would have to reboot to fix when scrolling through the gallery on the sd card it would freeze and the application would crash i moved what i could formatted the card but the same thing kept happeningsince installing the new transcend 8gb card i have had no such issues maybe its just my phone but i think there have been enough complaints from gs3 owners to be a little skeptical about this card on their phones,3.0

great formatting requires extra stepsvery satisfied with the speed and the space on this little guynote you need to format this on a cellphone that can be capable of using micro sd xc or on a card reader that is compatible with sd xc because if you do not do that you will only see it as a 32gb i got a couple of errors because i had formatted first on a computer with a sd hc reader not xc but now it is working fine,5.0
greati bought this for my surface retweet tablet and it works great and love how it came with the adapter,5.0
great inexpensive upgrade for your microsoft surface tabletrecently i bought a microsoft surface retweet tablet and used the 32gb version of this memory card worked great and i did not have any problems so when i heard that the surface retweet could be expanded to 64gb i immediately looked for a great deal online behold amazon offered this card for under 50 and it was prime eligible woohoo to me it was a nobrainer and i quickly ordered this inexpensive upgrade like its predecessor it comes with the memory card an sd card adapter and a small plastic case installing the card is super easy on the surface because you just line it up with the slot and push it in till it clicks that is it no formatting required and the card runs quite fast normally i buy sandisk extreme memory cards which are faster but this particular card had no problem running video files or playing musicanyway if you get this card for your surface retweet tablet do not format it why well the card is already formatted so why risk messing up your card just pop it in and enjoy greater space on your surfacenote as far as i know you cannot install surface applications onto the memory card only media files and documents still this card is a great upgrade and i highly recommend it,5.0

no problemsi searched for an inexpensive 64 gb micosdxc card for my new samsung galaxy note 101 2014 edition 32gb tablet and this one caught my eyes regarding positive comments and price the note was a christmas gift and it will be used for media entertainment while on business travel and as a replacement for an aging toshiba notebook there were no problems with the install the card was recognized upon bootup after the installation i do not require great transfer speeds for my tasks a quick test using es file explorer copying a 400 mb media file from the tablet os card to this expansion card yielded 10 mbs write and 40 mbs read speed which is more than sufficient for all my tasks as a bonus i added this card to my shopping cart at 4699 and the following day the price dropped to 3799 that was all the incentive needed to push the place your order button i cannot speak much of reliability since i have had the card installed for less than two weeks so far it has been stable,5.0

worked perfectly with my galaxy note however it is slow to write toi inserted this into my galaxy note powered the phone on and went into storage i pressed on mount sd card it said it did not understand the filesystem and asked if i wanted to format it i did and then i saw 59 gigs of free spaceworks great and got it for 43 bucks off amazonconit is extremely slow to write to if i try to write a 3gb file from my pc to the card it takes about 26 minutes 2mb a sec if i write to the internal sd card on my phone it writes at 10mb a sec i do not understand why it is that slow i can accept that it will be slower than an internal sd however i did not know it would be dog slow my 32gb samsung micro sd was much faster,1.0

lot of storage for the price and sizei am still stuck 10 years ago when microsd cards were fairly new they were and still are neat its amazing at how much you can put on something that is literally the size of a fingernail i purchased this class 10 64gig exclusively for use with mygopro hero3 black editionso that the card can keep up when the camera is recording hd at 60fps its amazing how many people are not aware of the classes of these data cards and how it can affect performance and capturing of video and even stills if you have tried capturing video only for it to shut off automatically it may be because your memory is not fast enough to keep up but youll have no problems keeping up with this card nor should you have problems storing it all this sandisk memory often gets labeled the best of the cheap memory but i am unsure how the expensive poor memory does why would anyone buy anything else more expensive this is the card to get it is so good i have also purchase two 32gig cards for our samsung s4s,5.0

does what it is supposed to doi have two of these that i am using with a gopro hero3 and they work great i will be getting more while i could do the 64gb i so far am preferring the 32gb because the card is about full right when a battery reaches the end of it is life so i can swap a card and battery at the same time and save openingclosing the case and swapping parts all of the time the card is plenty fast never had any hiccups with that and they have proven to be quite reliable as i have a 3rd card that i have been using in multiple mobile phones htc and bed and breakfast since 2010 and have never had any problem at all with any of them,5.0

sandisk ultra 32 gb microsdhc class 10sandisk chips are pretty good but relatively expensive at timesyoud think that online prices would be more affordable it can be but you can not tell if the seller is selling a fake product ot notthe one i received was genuine any of sandisk products can be returned and exchanged for another if genuine so i have not had a problem in exchanges with the company knocks on woodthe 32gb version works well with android tablets but not the 64gb versions so beware i did read online at other forums that the 64gb version works relatively well though with android phones which is weirdwhy would it work on the smartphone but not the tabletprices have dropped so it may have come down in prices at local retail stores so do shop around,4.0

what a money saverback when i purchased my samsung galaxy s4 the deciding factor between it and the iphone was the capability of sd card storage so when the chance came to grab a 32gb card for 20 dollars i jumped on it it performs flawlessly and comes with a standard sized sd card so you can fit the micro into it and access it from your computerfolks if you purchase an android phone with sd card capabilities do not go for the 32gb phone and pay up to a hundred dollars more just grab a micro sd card for less and thank me in the morning,5.0

good card great customer servicei am using the 64 gb card in a galaxy note ii phone and have had the card working perfectly from march to october the speeds were fast and it always worked flawlesslythen one day i decided to protect my data prior to going to europe by encryping the card in the phonethe encryption process went properly and took about 3 hours as my card was filled with about 18 gb of mostly image fileshowever the phone then slowed down considerably and it took up to 10 second to decrypt the card every time i woke the phone up the screen needless to say i did not like that and decided to return the card back to decrypted state i did the procedure of decrypting it back and when it was done the card became urneadable attempting to format it in the phone as well as in the computer with various utilities programs did not help the card showed those old folders being present despite multiple formats but i could neither access the files nor permanent write to the card the phone could save pictures to the card while it is powered on but after restaring the phone the newly taken pictures were gonei contacted sandisk who graciously exchange the card which now work great again i give the card 4 stars just because i do not know whether the experienced problem was due to the card or the phone the sandisk has shown itself to have great customer service and i really appreciate them exchanging the card i will definitely not encrypt it anymore when card works it works super fast and reliably,4.0

perfect for primary and temp storagei have tested this card in both a samsung galaxy note 3 phone and asamsung galaxy tab 3 101inchand it was immediately recognized by both devices as i write this review the card has been running in my tab 3 and constantly used for over a weekother reviews have dissected the specs of this card so i will share how i use it and why i prefer these over the 64gb cards which i also own and use the price point on these 32gb cards have dramatically fallen and as of the date of this review they are priced as commodities i use a few pairs of these to rotate backups on my laptop so i always have a daily snapshot of my documents for that purpose alone these cards are well worth itfor my tablet i have divided my extensive music library into genres and have them backed up to these cards a 32gb card will hold about 150 cds so the space savings along over the physical media is significant in fact one of these cards cost about the same as a rack for 150 cdsthese are also excellent for saving practice sessions that i sometimes record using my phone or tablet i pop my primary sd card out of the device and swap one of these in to video record since this card will hold about six hours of video it is perfect for that useoverall these are reliable cards that have worked in a number of devices i own i can assure anyone wanting to use them in a newer samsung note 2 or 3 phone or tab 3 tablet that this card will work and it is also excellent for hd video recording at the price point it is an absolute bargain,5.0

may be a little slowmy droid razr runs a little slow is it because of this card i cannot be sure what i am sure about is i put this card into my gopro hero 3 black edition and the video i record comes out choppy so i bought the sandisk extreme pro 16gb version of this card and the gopro works fine now sandisk is normally very good so perhaps i somehow got a bad ultra card i never returned or exchanged it because the warranty had expired before i tried it in my gopro and knew for sure the card was slow the sandisk ultra should work in the gopro hero 3 according to the gopro website so again perhaps i just got a subpar card,3.0

good cheap card but slow transfersi purchased this card for use in a microsoft surface pro tablet for that it works great 64gb is a nice capacity card was cheap and it works just finethe problem however was in transfer speed it is rated at up to 30mbsec which i guess is true but mine has never reached anywhere close to that using 3 different readers the surface pro itself a higherend desktop pc with builtin microsd reader and an external usb 30 microsd reader in all it maxed out around 1012mbsec and on multiple smaller files it maxed out closer to about 5mbsec total i know it is not the card readers as i have been able to reach speeds of 90mbsec with otherfaster cardsthe card itself does work fine for that i give it 5 stars the price is great for the size for that i give it 5 stars the transfer speeds are just disappointing though taking 5 minutes to transfer an itunes movie file is a long time it will take hours to fill the full card if you only load data once it is not so bad but if youre always addingdeletingmoving data it is slow and will get annoying quickly,4.0

watch price great card often on salemy review is a little backwards but i thought the most relevant should go firstwarning only buy this card on salethe typical price since summer 2013 is about 24 for 32 gb and about 48 for 64 gb do not pay any more than this and you can actually pay less if you have the luxury of time patiencethe lowest nonlightning price hit about 1800 for 32gb and 35 for 64gb in early december i basically buy when the price hits 20 or less and the 64 nears 40from december 2013 to january 2014 i watched these cards change price on an almost daily basis they initially went on sale for about 1795 and 3495 for 32 and 64 respectively i watched them slowly increase in price with random dips and peaks for a month on january 6th 2014 they still show as a best deal on amazon for 7 more days but they are at the highest price point since last summer and higher than i have ever payed for these cards so do not let the best deals section deceive you at 2750 these are not a deal in terms of priceokay heres my actual review of these absolutely great sdxc cardsi have tried a variety of microsdxc cards and so far the samsung ultra uhs1 are the best and the price cannot be beat for all the most important reasons speed capacity reliability durabilityi have not had a single failure and i use these cards in my nook hd nexus 7 2013 via usb and my canon 5d mark ii with converter and macbook pro in the card slot they are durable and waterproof and i can use the same card in all these devices without reformatting i even had one go through the wash and i still use it for picturesfor the technically inclined i have cards with both the clockwork mod bootloader for the nook hd and the magiclantern firmware for my canon eos 5d ii on the same card i can pull it from the nook shoot pictures with the camera and look at the results on the nook by just pulling the card out of one device and placing it in the other this should be possible with any sdxcsdhc card but it turns out that the samsung uhs1 is the only card i have found that works reliably some cards would not boot because they are too slow too finicky but all my samsung uhs1s work great the 64gb will not boot in the nook but no 64gb card willi keep my eyes open for price drops on these cards because they have performed so well for me samsung also has a newer faster card but its pricepoint hovers somewhere north of prohibitive so i still stick with these and that is good news regardless because as the new card increases its market share these should drop even further in price,5.0
corrupted within a weekmaybe i got a defective card but this one felt a bit thinner and flimsier than other microsd cards i have hadthe real problem was after a week of use as expanded storage in a tablet i started having trouble with certain programs installed on the card then finally the tablet gave me a message that the card was corrupt and while a pc would recognize it eery time i tried to format the card there would be an error,1.0

great memory cardi bought this memory card for my smartphone nokia lumia 521 when my older 8gb micro sd card died on me amazon basics brandi threw on some mp3s on there to listen on my phone on my trip up the california coast since i knew some areas wouldnt have any radio or cell phone reception and had no problems with iti have not done any speed tests on it as i am not using it for anything that needs extreme speeds its has more than enough speed for capturing video and and picturesits a great deal for the amount of storage and its price,5.0

sandisk is the standard in memory cardswhat can i say the card works perfectly have not had a single issue with it i had a sandisk card at one point that did not work properly and sandisks customer service was great in replacing my product which is the reason i will keep giving them my business,5.0
fantasticalthis came two days ahead of schedule and installed right away the only peeve people might have is that it comes in so much packaging that i gave it to my friend bruce banner and he went all hulk on it and could not get it open so we had to use scissors like it says on the packaging should have read the instructions on the packaging first now i have to buy a new house because it is all smashed up,5.0
decent but slowits a pretty cheap card and has a good amount of storage but it has fairly slow write performance some competitors microsd cards offer much faster performance for similar prices,3.0

ran hot and then started randomly disconnecting until it diedi noticed a long time ago that even when not really running at very fast speeds and i am mostly talking about reading as mostly it was playing music and video files this card seems to get fairly warm after a while pretty much just outside the point at which i could rma it it started randomly disconnecting at first i thought it was my phone though i had no clue why it would ever do such a thing so i wouldnt have sent it in at that point anyway it always seemed to be fine when i plugged it into my computer over time it got worse and worse and i would have to remove and put it back in quite a few times to get it to finally work eventually it started doing this on the computer too and that is when i realized something was fishy i switched to another card in my phone and the problems went away on the other hand this one stopped working completely a bit later even in the computermaybe i just got a bad one but right now i would rather get a different one instead if i were to buy a new one,2.0
great itemthis sd card was exactly what we were looking for the last one we purchased got deleted and unformatted by the phone so we decided to replace it this is a great price and came with the adapter too,5.0
nothing but troublei am hoping that i received a defective product and that my experience is rare but this product did not work as intended i was replacing another 32g micro sd card thinking that because this is a class 10 rated product it would be faster it never worked correctly it kept dismounting unexpectedly losing data and was just not worth the money at all i ended up using my slower rated product which has worked reliably since the day i bought it i only wish this product had done the same,1.0
quality producti bought exactly the same micro sdhc sandisk ultra 32gb about a year ago and which i am using daily this stuff is reliable it has never gave me any sort of problem my setup for this card is like a hard drive in a pc where i readwrite a lot of large amount of data everytime like video files photos maps documents and it has been working flawlessly not an instance i recall that it failed me and also it is fast my tablet is my pc now and i am using it for several hours each day all of my data are set to be read and written into this external disk i could not be more happier i had use other brands in the past but somehow it did not meet my expectations the new disk i ordered will be my backup copy just in case i lost my tablet,5.0
perfecti purchased this as a recommendation to use with a ls300w dashcam like most dashcams there is constant high definition writing to the sd card because of needed looping this works as expected reliable and fast,5.0
not necessarily a bad product you just need to make sure that it is compatiblei think that this product by itself is a great product however not all devices is built for microsd xc and not all devices like pad and phone that specifically states that it features microsd with compatability to microsd xc this happened to me since i just bought a new pad i thought that it would be compatible however it did not the microsd xc is formatted with exfat so my device can detect the hardware but it cannot write or read from it,2.0
failed after about 5 usesi purhcased this card for my hero 3 cam it worked all of last year or the 34 times i used it i used it again this year and had some great once in a life time ski videos and the card failed it could not be read or reformatted i lost all my vids it was strictly used in my hero 3 cam i pulled it out to try to retreive the vids using several pcs multiple card readers and recovery software but no good i have never known a card to fail and i am extremely disappointedtry another brand next time i will use multiple cards with smaller storage and a different brand,1.0

32gb two out of two could not pass writereadbacki bought two of the 32 gb sandisk ultra microsdhc cards and both of them were unusablethe first one stopped accepting new data when i had put a bit less than one gig of data onto the card i could not add more files and i could not reformat the card if i tried to write a new file onto the card the write operation seemed as if it worked but the new data could not be read back successfully the files already on the card were still readable though so basically the card had become a 1 gb rom fortunately there was no sensitive personal information on the card so i returned it to amazonthe second one did not fail the same way but it was still unusable if i transferred a bunch of files and then read them back most of the transferred files had data errors for example a 3 minute music file might only be able to have it is first minute of music played back then the bad data would stop the music player i ran a writereadback test and confirmed that there were data errors on nearly every block tested i used flash drive tester v114exe which is a free downloadi ended up buying the equivalent transcend producttranscend information ts32gusdc10 32gb micro sdhc10 flash memory no box or adapterwhich has been performing flawlessly i have over half of the capacity in use and i have never seen any sign of data loss or corruption for usb plug in flash drives i have had good luck with sandisk products but my experience with the sandisk microsdhc cards has been terrible,1.0
good company bad producti can say that sandisk is one of the best company in the fields of electronics and digital cameras but i am very dissapointed of this memory cardthe card memory is only 25gb and the speed is 14mbs which is not as advertisedi gave it to my dad to use it on his phone and i started to use the sony 32gb microsd i can say that it works perfectly the storage is 32gb and the speed is 43mbsbuy it now this is the exact link i used to buy mine,1.0

fast good with gopro 3i use this product with the gopro 3 black edition it works fantastic even at 27k resolution and imports very fast especially over usb 3 card readers i almost always go with sandisk these days for flash ram they invented much of it and it shows,5.0
great but not perfecti bought this a little under a year ago to use with my laptop worked just as advertised for much of that time until it stopped letting me write or delete stuff from it could read just fine i could not even format it so it kinda just sat there for a while after trying to format it a number of different ways i finally contacted sandisk and they said they will send me a replacement free of charge i would have maybe given this a lower rating but the customer service from sandisk made up for the faulty card i am just glad it fell under a warranty period i think had the card not failed i would have given five stars if sandisk wouldnt replace it would have given one star hopefully the latter does not happen to you,3.0

perfect for samsung galaxy s4i had to format it as fat32 you can google for how to do that but once you do it works great i will never understand why people would ever buy a phone that does not have a microsd slot with this you can fill it up with whatever you want such as movies tv shows music and share it with whoever you want just pop it in your phone and you are all set for a long trip airplane ride and so on i never need to worry about running out of space when taking full hd videos either,5.0
great pricei bought this 64gb memory card for my minicamcorder now i have unlimited picture and video taking capabilities no more packing extra memory cards for me,5.0
really fasti bought this for my samsung galaxy s4 because it had little available memory on board unfortunately the phone does not allow for the user to move applications to the sd card but that is not the cards fault it is the phones fault the card itself works great and seems to transfer very quickly my full 1080p hd videos have no trouble recording directly to the card,5.0
all goodit works fairly fast definitely not 30mbs fast when copying off of it via a usb 30 adapter and absolutely much slower when writing to it but that is true about all of these memory cards it is just some are worse than others,5.0

ultra fast sd cardthis is an ultra fast sandisk branded sd card that is great for digital cameras especially for video i got it for my smartphone mainly for the 32 gb capacity and it fills the bill at a very low price with prime shipping you cannot get better quality flash cards than sandisk i am still amazed that they can cram such a huge amount of memory on such a tiny chip one megabyte of data in text from printed out would fill a pickup truck this chip has 32 thousand megabytes think about having 320 pickup trucks full of text in a chip smaller than your pinky fingernail,5.0
works as it shouldthe card i received works perfectly in my samsung note 2 it comes with a converter to normal sd size and i used it to copy music and photos from my imac to the card it picked up straight away in my mobile device and works fast enough for taking pictures and videos with the mobiledelivery was fast as usual from amazon and packaging was goodon a sidenote i own a couple of dslr cameras and generally prefer the sandisk brand for my memory cards i have seen other brands fail at the most inappropriate of times but never had a failure on a sandisk,5.0

dead after 10 monthsused it for my samsung galaxy tab 2 101 tablet stopped working after about 10 months without warnings my tablet now recognizes as blank or unformatted card my computers would not even recognize it at all i am still trying to recover some priceless photos of my kids since my last backup of the card,2.0
turned my 32gb smartphone into a 160gb smartphoneas soon as i learned that my nokia lumia 1520 would gladly accept 128gb microsd card i sought one out the 119 promo price on amazon had evaporated along with the stock of the rare cards the price had skyrocketed to nearly 200 and they were out of stock i pined i whined then one day in early may there it was back on amazon for the awesome price point of 119 i pulled the trigger immediately well apparently the cards were on backorder but in was a short wait four days later i had my card after formatting it via the phone ands changing all my phone settings to save everything to the card i am a happy camper readwrite speeds are good and the only really noticible lag is when taking photos but that has a lot to do with my choosing to take photos with a 5mp low rest version and a corresponding 16mp raw version too other than that this drive has allowed me to store 1gb applicationsgames of which i have many and tons of pics and 1080p videos i would say that if your phone accepts 128gb cards this is a no brainer,5.0
top of the class among all budgetpriced microsdhc cards i have tested works great in galaxy s3i have tested dozens of sdhc and microsdhc cards one disturbing trend i noticed is that the speed class rating for microsdhc is typically inflated for example a class10 rating means the card must deliver a sequential write speed of at least 10mbs but somehow a class10 microsdhc cards is always slower than a class10 sdhc card from the same manufacturer case in point thepny 32 gb microsdhc card psdu32g10efs2claims to be class10 yet it can only write at 86mbs maximum while the fullsizepny psdhc16g10achieved 134mbs according to crystaldiskmark v301thissandisk ultra 32 gb microsdhc class 10 uhs1 card sdsdqua032gu46a however proves to be the exception it achieved a sequential write speed of over 10mbs according to two different benchmark programs 118mbs in crystaldiskmark 106mbs in h2testw v14 this is faster than all my other microsdhc cards including two class10 cards frompnyandpolaroida closer look at the file transfer speed using flash memory toolkit revealed another nice surprise for writing small files this sandisk ultra microsdhc card performed just as well as its fullsize counterpart thesandisk ultra sdhc sdsdu032gaffp in contrast all my other class10 microsdhc cards perform poorly while writing smaller files see the benchmark results i uploaded to customer images for detailswhen you use a memory card in a digital camera to record hd video it needs to store a huge video file each session that means its sequential write speed is most critical when used in a tablet or a smart phone however the cards random write speed for small files is more important that is why in such applications the sandisk microsdhc will perform faster than the pny and polaroid cards even though they are also rated as class10bottom lineas of this writing the sandisk ultra microsdhc card ia actually priced lower than other class10 cards from pny and polaroid this makes the sandisk the best value especially if you need honest class10 performance across all platformsside notes do not confuse this sandisk ultra card withsandisk mobile ultra microsdhc sdsdqy032gu46a the latter is rated for class6 only the size of this 32gb card is 297gb according to my computer this is actually normal because computer people count one gig as 2 to the power 30 which is 73 larger than one billion so 297gb translates to 319 billion bytes which is 32gb according to marketing peopleupdate on feb 4 20131 amazon combined the sandisk ultra 32gb and 64gb cards on the same product page please beware that your intended appliance must be compatible with sdxc in order to used the 64gb version my original review refers to the 32gb sdhc version2 there are two part numbers for the same card if you start from the amazon product page and select retail packaging youll see the part number of sdsdqua032gu46a but if you click on frustration free package the part number changes to sdsdqu032gaffpaupdate on oct 5 2013the sandisk microsdhc card works great in my new samsung galaxy s3 without the need for reformat the default format is fat32update on dec 26 2013my old test results were limited by the card reader and usb 20 port used i retested the sandisk uhs1 micro card using thetranscend rdf5 card readerconnected to an usb 30 port here are the results from crystaldiskmark 301 x64 sequential read speed 400mbs was 348mbs when connected to usb 20 port sequential write speed 131mbs was 126mbs when connected to usb 20 port,5.0

purchased from amazonreturned defective got another defectivepurchased for my android phone to provide more media storage the one i received was doa spoke with sandisk tech support who confirmed that it was a bad unit since it was within 30 days they suggested i return it to amazon instead of going through warranty procedures i returned it to amazon but made the mistake of requesting a replacement instead of a refund the replacement appeared to work at first but after a short while it caused my phone to reboot files went missing and displayed other forms of instability it was a bit late to return again so i contacted sandisk who replaced the unit under the warranty however this all took a lot of time necessitated repeated copying of many gbs of data and secure erasing of informationthe warranty replacement from sandisk works well so far however i am not seeing much improvement in my application over a similar 32gb class 4 sandisk microsdhc this one is class 10 would probably give the current unit 3 stars but this rating is for the amazon delivered units both defectiveif you do get a bad one i would suggest to return for refund not replacement,1.0

pretty fast for a microsdusing this in my galaxy s4 and it works fairly well i have transfered a bunch of files from the pc via a usb 30 memory card reader and ya know it is not blazing fast but it is pretty good for what it is it is certainly a lot more tolerable than pretty much any other microsd card i have usedthat said you get a minimum write speed that is good enough for 1080p video on a cell phone or other mobile device and will probably lead to faster times between shots if you use it in a camera phone if for no other reason than it takes less time to write the picture you just took to the disk vs say a cheaper sd cardit is a microsd card i have not had any problems go for it,5.0

did not work in samsung samsung galaxy tab 2it appears that the 32gb sandisk ultra micro sd card i purchased from amazon was defective i installed it in my samsung tablet but could not successfully transfer files using either a usb cable or wifi the file transfer would appear to start but then would slow down and hang completely it did this on every one of multiple attempts with different file types and numbers of files ranging from many to just a single file i tried loading files onto the card directly from my pc but then the tablet would not see them i tried reformatting the card both in my pc and in the tablet but still got the same result after a few tries the tablet would appear to format the card but then tell me that the card was blankunformatted i did an aba with an old 8gb sandisk micro sd card that i had laying around it worked perfectly formating transferring files reading and writing files everthing worked i put the 32gb sandisk ultra card back in the tablet but had the same problems again i concluded that the sandisk ultra card was defective and returned it i am still using the old 8gb card without a hiccupthe good thing was that amazons return policy was quick and painless,1.0

it is sandisk what more can i saythe name should speak for itself it comes with a regular sd card adapter if one day you feel that you have no need for a microsd card then just simply put it back into the adapter and use it as a regular sd card for your camera or other electronics that takes a form of a regular sd card it reads and write very fast which it should since it is a class 10 card i bought this for my samsung galaxy s4 and it is a nice addition to storing those big 1080p files mp3 music loads hands down the best brand in the industry for sd cards i highly recommend it,5.0

card failed after 15 weeksjust as with many other reviewers here my card worked perfectly for the first week and a half and then suddenly lost its format and could no longer be reformatted while at the same time overheating dangerously sandisk is currently issuing an rma to replace it but i am worried that the replacement could also end up being defective as is evident from the 1star reviews here the rate of such defects for these cards is about 10 which to me seems like an absolutely unacceptable number for a memory card for a major manufacturer and it is not like sandisk has not had a headsup on this problem the negative reviews have been there for quite a while clean up your act sandisk,1.0

seems glitchyi put this in my samsung skyrocket phone even though the phone says 32 gb max it still recognized and formatted the card its great to have all of that spacehowever any time i try to use the usb mass storage mode to transfer files it errors out i thought it was the phone since it was larger than the max spec but then i tried it in a usb card reader i had it still errored out trying the same files finally i had to put it in the adapter and stick it in a card reader built into a laptop and transfer the files that wayi think the issue was that using the usb 20 the files were writing too fast and faulting out and with the laptop transferring the files from the wireless network and then to the card the transfer speed was slow enough that it was successful took all night to get my stuff on the card thoughi use it mostly for pics and video on my phone also works great the phone seems to have no trouble accessing anything on the card and it seems plenty fast for it even when recording high def video which i do a lot of for work,3.0

died after one monththank god for amazon return policy or i would be incensed this little platic device from hell died unexpectedly after 37 days i lost all my phone pictures that were not stored on the phone i lost the music but have most on pc i lost the videos i had from concertswhat happened was the phone gave me a warning that the storage device sandisk ultra could not be found i took it out and restarted my galaxy note 2 and it worked then about one hour later i got the same warning i tried to save my data with my backup pro application i had to purchase an extra 3 gbs of data for cloud because the application comes with only 75 mb or something like that and so i backed up everything on the sandisk storage and as it was backing everything on line using the backup pro cloud the sandisk fried and stopped the backup process i was prompted to format the storage disc but everytime i performed this process the phone would not complete the format now keep in mind that i was not near a computer because i was on vacation so i could not use a computer to format in fat32i am returning this disc and purchasing a samsung 32 gb that costs over 50 bucks you get what you pay for,1.0

great price for the size until it diesgot it on sale for an incredible price the only way i am likely to upgrade from this is if they come out with a 128g size 64g is not necessary for my use but at 128 i would be able to use it without worry of running out of space and put my entire mp3 catalog on it as wellupdate about 4 months after i bought this and installed it in my galaxy s2 it started causing some trouble for my phone at first i did not realize it was the micro sd card causing the problem but it would occasionally have a status message saying something like unmount the sd card before removing it to avoid corrupting your data and eventually it did not even recognize that there was a card in there at all i put the old 1gb card back in and it works fine put the 32gb card into the adapter and put it into the computers card reader nothing wouldnt read it at alli do back up my phone occasionally maybe once a month but lost everything every photo and video i had taken of my new kitten since i got her because of this it is very surprising since sandisk is usually quite reliable my wife has the same card in her phone we got them around the same time and hers is still working normally so farymmv but always back up your data regularly more than once a month if you are taking a lot of pictures and video,1.0

great value excellent price but lacking extras4 stars for the excellent price and performance seems to be as advertised average copying speeds are around 1820mbsonly gripe is that sandisk does not include any extras that is a plastic protective case or bundle it with a sd card reader however can understand why at this price point,4.0
works with gtp5113 samsung tab 2the primary reason for buying this extra capacitysandisk ultra 64 gb microsdxc class 10card was to use it insamsung galaxy tab 2 101inch model gtp5113and i am happy to share that you can get this to work flawlessly after some initial glitches read belowfirstly you need to be aware that the samsung tablet model gtp5113 currently runs with android os 411 with kernel 3031523998 and build number jro03cp5113ueclk7jelly bean my experiences shared here are with that level of android os your experiences may vary depending on what version of os you are running the sandisk ultra 64 gb microsdxc card purchased from amazon retail packaging gets recognized just fine however when the tablets media device aka mtp application attempts to talk your pc via usb cable the tablet simply reboots and after that the card is presented to the pc really strange indeedthis baffled me for couple of hours firstly i attempted to format the card exfat in pc and it formatted just fine after that i attempted to use it in the tablet to see the same behavioral oddity of instantaneous reboot of the tablet as mtp application tries to communicate with the pc this made me investigate the issue further and i determined the root cause was the fact that sandisk now seen to factory format the card with exfat but also somehow seen to include an offset of 16mb at the beginning of the card which shows up as 16mb unallocated region in the initial sectors on this card under windows disk management toolthe solution is to get rid of that unallocated 16mb partition on the card you could do it in pc but that might require some windows command line experience and using diskpart utility and what not and i do not want to confuse people here with that process for most novice users the process should be very simple just insert the card on the tablet and use the native sd card format tool under settings that android os 411 has and it will get rid of that 16mb partition and happily remount it now after this simple process the mtp application works just fine with pc to transfer files to the sd card without any strange reboot phenomenonnot sure why sandisk formats their class 10 card in this fashion they never did it with their class 6 cards earlier and there is gotta be some technical explanation for why they include that 16mb partition that only sandisk can give in the end if you reformat the card in the tablet which defaults to exfat the card is seen to work just finebottomlinethis is an awesome 64gb capacity microsd card from a reputed manufacturer for budget minded people and gets the job done beautifully the read and write speeds are adequate enough for most audiovideo picture file formats in a tablet the glitch mentioned above forced me to give four stars instead of five stars but let that not stop you from making a decision to buy ithighly recommendedcheers,4.0
works great with my gs3i purchased this because my samsumg galaxy s3 was getting full of pictures it installed easy works great and i have had no speed issues when writing or reading from it,5.0
worked on my s3 out of the packageive had this memory card in my s3 for the past few months without any issues the only problem i have had with this was when i initially copied the 30gb of data from my old card to this card i had this connected to my laptop using a microsd usb adapter and the copies kept failing i figured out that the card was overheating when writing a lot of data i was able to copy the data by pointing a small desk fan towards the card adapter during the file copy process that being said i do not have any readwrite problems due to overheating with the card installed in my phone i have copied over a couple of gigs of movies to watch on some trips with the card installed in the phone without any failures it may be that heat issue only occurs after pushing 3gb of data at a time the largest movie i copied to the phone was 2gb most of the other movies are just over a gigthe only prep work for use in my phone was the initial format when it was first installed the card was recognized prior to the formatting but i had seen where others had readwrite issues so the format was a preemptive move,5.0
works as advertisedi do not have too much to say about an sd card but i wanted to at least give it the 5 stars it deserves we used it in a galaxy s3 and it has worked flawlessly so far i have not run any benchmarks to confirm the speed and so on but it does not seem to hinder the phone or camera which we now have saving photosvideos to the sd card in any wayi will point out the the s3 camera application did notify us that burst mode shots will still write to the phones internal memory potentially due to the high date of data being written that is good to know if you use burst mode a lot and were hoping to use an sd card for that purpose,5.0
64gb is a ton of space for a phonecame quick and works well with my galaxy s4 formating was simple its a sandisk not much that could be wrong with it,5.0
have card will travelfull disclosure i use no other brand of sd card other than sandiskhaving said that i was pleased to discover an sd card designed for people who demand fast transfer speeds for hd video applications i purchased this item for my tablet pc and have been pleased with its functionality the adapter is great for accessing via computer to transfer files directly if usb is not desired,5.0
gopro heroits been working for over 4 years on my gp camera has not crashed nor failed me i have shot over a hundred hours of footage on this card i will buy again for sure,5.0
works very wellperforms as expected i bought for mi galaxy s3 to increase it storage options when i need to transfer big files i use a usb adapter since the wifi and mtp conectios speed is far slower than directly connecting the device but that is not the cards problem its fast reading and writing inside the s3 and when connected to a current generation computerold computers will read and write at slower speeds but is still compatible hardware wise the exfat format can be a hassleno problems yet hardware wise i would have preferred an open standard as partition format instead of exfat but that is microsoft fault not sandiskis easy to reformat with a usb sdmicrosd adapter,5.0
good speed and performanceworks well with my dslr have never been able to fill it i guess 16gb would be enough for average use go for faster speeds and smaller size,5.0
included adapter made these micro sd cards a good dealuse it with the included adapter as a spare card for my panasonic fz200 lumix camera and as a quick and easy temporary backup drive for my macbook pro laptop which has a standard sd slot also use it to make a quick transfer of files between the laptop and an imac works exactly like a fullsize sd card for these purposes very fast and reliable data transfers and the special price from amazon made these cards less costly than the standard 32 gb card at the timeupdate i have changed the star rating from a 5 to a 4 this micro card worked fine for about three months and then suddenly began to disappear from the laptop finder it still shows up and works fine when mounted in the desktop imac but often it will not mount in the laptop this could be a problem with the laptop and if that turns out to be the case i will restore this to a 5star rating,4.0
averages 10mbsec write 30mbsec readpretty much as stated above write rate holds up well from small files to large files reads vary from 2533mbsec but holds pretty steadily via card reader in supplied sd adapter through motorola photon q and through the sandisk sddr121a11m adapter via usb 20 and on either pc i have,5.0

great priceand good product i have not had any issue with the san disk memory cards so i prefer to stay with them i have several electronic devices what use the micro sd and they all work great i would recommend this product,5.0
meets published specs but there are faster less expensive optionsfirst off i have always bought sandisk for the warranty under the reasoning that a lifetime warranty means they must be a little better than the others and sandisks lesser lines i have 5 class 6 sd 8gb extreme i series cards all pushing 5 years old now with zero problems all of which write nearly twice as fast not sure what the limitation is class 10 uhs1 and 5 year newer tech should blow these away the micro packaging should not make a difference either i can only guess it is marketing differentiationagain this card will write at published specs but you may want to check out the sony sr32uyatqmn of the same capacity it reads and writes faster and is a similar price though only a one year warranty i picked it up with a hisense 7 pro tablet awesome and could not wait and they were on sale locally for 26 was a pleasant surprise came with a sd adapter as well and some file recovery software a link not a fan of sony web sites support or or documentation for any of their gear the last 15 years but these are commodities now i suppose and you cannot expect much any longer i now kind of think if these things work 30 days they will probably work 510 years until they are obsolete for your informationthe sandisk and sony are both made in china,4.0
good card good pricei was pleasantly surprised that my card arrived ahead of schedule that is always a plus in my book the works without a hitch i was able to copy the files from my 16gb card to this one relatively quickly and very easily my samsung galaxy tab 2 70 read the card perfectly i have no complaints about the card although i expected the write speed to be a little faster after all is said and done i would definitely recommend this card for your tablet smart phone or any other device that allows for expandable memory,4.0
goodfor less than a yeardecent transfer speeds out of phonein phone sees around 1012mbs down to 5 this card is nothing to write home about however as it only lasted me 7 months now it will not read in my phone or laptop or friends phone so now i lost all my filesi recommend you store your vital files in the phone,3.0

completely worthlessthis ultra high speed card is about half the speed of the class 4 card i was using 10mbs read and 6mbs write is more than a little below where a device with this rating should perform i could believe if it was the same speed as my old card maybe my brand new samsung galaxy tab 2 7 does not have a uhs1 rated port but to be half the speed of my class 4 card this uhs1 thing clearly is penciled on by marketing monkeys and sold without any testing or quality control i wish i knew how to rate with 0 stars,1.0

shame on sandisk very low write speedthe description is quite confusing it says at same time class 10 which means that you should not expect write speed higher than 10mbsec and at the same time it says uhs1 which means 30mbsec write speed the truth as usually is somewhere in the middle but close to lower end i have a dedicated high speed pcie cardreader which i use for chip benchmarking so this card showed 12mbsec sequental write speed and 34mbsec sequental read speed so uhs1 is true only for read operations meaning that if you wanted this card to speedup your digital camera speed photography youve made the wrong choice just for reference this cardtranscend 16 gb class 10 microsdhc flash memory card ts16gusdhc10has sequental write speed of 17mbsec and sequental read speed of 24mbsec as you see the cheaper transcend has average 40 faster write speeds,1.0

not much different from class 4s i have used go for cheaper cardif you were looking for a class 10 microsd card in order to directly transfer files from your pc to your phone the fastest way possible you can go with a cheaper class 4 instead of this one the speed is not much different than other class 4 microsd cards i have had it is very far from the 30mbs they promise i got only about 45mbs at much and after a few minutes it is downhill from there i tested on both windows and linux and did not see a difference luckily there is not a lot of difference in price between a high quality class 4 and this one but then again maybe i did not look at the class 4 the way i should have since i was focused on getting a class 10 oh well youve been warned do not expect magic from this cardupdate 12112013 sandisk proactively answered this review to ask me to contact them the reason i did not contact them first it is because you usually receive slimy answers from this tech support and hardly any solution or help it is indeed a waste of time after sandisk comment i contacted them through one of their live chat agents and this is the interchange my suspicious were confirmed and i indeed wasted my timedaniel s hello thank you for contacting sandisk my name is daniel s please give me a moment while i look into your questionfer da heyfer da i just got this answer from sandisk cd notf messagethat isutf8cdforumfxfnzei17mh7ndcdpage1cdthreadtx7vkc9upwni9xmx3fkeev0wiile3daniel s please tell me what is written on the face of the memory cardfer da never thought of contacting you because i thought i was just going to waste my time but it was nice to be contacted proactively by youfer da okfer da the same thing as the one on the picturefer da sandisk ultrafer da microsdhc ifer da 32gbdaniel s please allow me a momentfer da will you need more info from the carddaniel s the sandisk ultra card is a uhsi card and provides optimum performances when used with a uhsi enabled device or card readerfer da my phone is off lolfer da it says that it is a class 10 card i bought it because of the promise of better speeds than the regular class 4 when using it with my phonedaniel s i would like to inform you that you will get the minimum read speed of 10 mbps on a uhsi enable device as the card is built on the uhsi technologyfer da and write speedsfer da i am getting like 4mbsfer da a far cry from the 30 mbs2 promiseddaniel s i would like to inform you that so i said the card is built on the uhsi technology it will give the optimum speed with an uhsi enable devicedaniel s you will get the minimum write speed of 10 mbps with an uhsi enable devicefer da okfer da waste of time confirmeddaniel s i would like to inform you that if youll use this card with an uhsi enable device it will give you the optimum speed as it is promisedaniel s is there anything else i may assist you withremoved one star because of the sliminess of contacting me via amazon to show sandisk cares but not really offering any real support when contacted,2.0

fast flexibleive started buying all of my sd cards with the adapter these is no reason to limit myself with having a large card when i need a small one at first i was concerned about connection reliability when the small card was inserted into the large one but i have not had a single problem so farthis one performed as expected and otherwise is more flexible than a standard large size sd card fully recommended,5.0
frequent memory card errors that prompt reformatting when used with a logitech alert 750ei bought two of these memory cards for use with my logitech alert 750e outdoor master security cameras so far i have found them to be unreliable i am not entirely certain if this is because of the camera system or the memory card themselves the camera frequently will report a memory card error that indicates the card has to be reformatted this is problematic as if the camera had recorded something that was important the failure of the sd card would be very troublesome indeed,2.0
does a good job buta well made replacement part for use with my system reads and writes quickly to my camera the down side i do not like the size of this card very tiny and often difficult to remove from my canon camera not a reflection on the san disk card quality but the industry move into microminiture cards i would not buy another camera using micro sd cards,4.0
resolving confusion between mobile ultra and ultra sandiskthe last few days i have been diligently shopping for a microsdxc card to utilize in my new smart phone i have a long term positive experience using sandisk cards i quickly became confused about the differences between the so called mobile ultra cards and the ultra cards the performance specs to my intermediate tech experience eyes were virtually the same the prices were also similar with the mobileversion slightly higher to finally resolve my confusion i contacted sandisk technical support to my surprise the mobile version is the older no longer manufactured version the ultra is the current model so i immediately bought the current ultra version which very fortunately amazon had on sale,5.0
works with go pro hero 3no problems to report works as described scandisk makes a very stable product for temporary storing and later transferring of images and video footage,5.0
so farso goodi am cautiously optimistic but happy because amazon sent my replacement promptly i ordered a 32gb card and it came broken so i returned with followed with an email asking for immediate shippingand it arrived just in time for my trip i am cautiously optimistic because out of four cards i have purchased from amazon this is the only one that works so far but i got refunded for the rest,5.0
seamless experiencei put this microsd card in my note ii phone and i have had a seamless experience with it programs that are on the card operate as quickly and flawlessly as those that are on my phones memory it will hold dozens of programs and gives me all the expandibility that i will need unless i start collecting hd movies on my phone this card seems to be designed specifically for smartphones and does its job very well recommended,5.0
great memory carda great memory card at a very good price i recently upgraded to this memory card for use in my cell phone and it has plenty of space to hold all of my music videos and photos i can download as many songs as i want and take as many photos at the highest quality as i want without having to worry about the memory on my phone filling upi have used sandisk memory cards many times before and i have always had very good experiences it is still too early to tell if this card will live up to that standard but so far this memory card has worked very well for methe class 10 rating refers to the speed with which it writes to the card and i have noticed that it is quicker than my previous micro sd card as an upgrade and expansion to your smartphones memory i highly recommend this card,5.0
works fine looking forward to bigger sizesusing in a surface pros microsd slot i even reformatted to ntfs which they claim is not recommended in order to set up a virtual disk file on it and automount that virtual disk upon startup so that my music library can be on this win 8 is kind of picky about letting you set up what it considers removable volumes as directories to be autoscanned for libraries and this is one workaroundamazing to me that something the size of my pinky nail can hold my entire music collection at a nice high bitrate and still have much more room left over one star off because its a tiny bit slow to write to but that might not be fair since i am comparing to fullsize sd and i did reformat as i said,4.0

hoping for betterthis is the second card i have purchased of this exact model the first one i had went bad after about 8 months to be fair i had it in a rooted galaxy s3 with cm101 loaded on it so it is possible that something in the experimental firmware messed up the cardi am back on the stock rom now due to issues with 4g lte i am not even rooted anymore so i am hoping that the card remains solid this time everyone else seems to love it so i am hoping serves me well for a long timeso far so good,4.0

slightly short on speed but really close and great overall cardworked as expected in both my blackberry z10 and my horsepower laptop and is plenty fast writes at around 95mbsec but reads so far on my pc that i cannot get an accurate number for the speed i gave it four stars because the write speed falls a touch short of the class 10 rating it is honestly not enough to be an issue for me but people who need the speed in a camera might be slightly disappointed however the capacity and price more than make up for that in my mindalso makes a great store for content in my blackberry,4.0
the card crashed a few timesi use it for my galaxy s4 and this card crashed on me few times i lost all my photos and music thankfully they were all backed up but the worst part is the card completely stopped working at one point i had to contact sandisk for a replacement and it was a hassle,3.0

unreliable in samsung galaxy s3i thought this was a sure winner from the average 45 rating with thousands of reviews but if you notice the bad reviews involve the card becoming unreliable after a couple weeks of use typically people write reviews shortly after receiving the product my card worked fine for 2 weeks and then started having problems i reformatted the card reinserted in the phone removed the battery every trick i could read about but the card still remained unreliable and the phone was thinking it was being removed at random times so i stuck my olders slower 8gb microsd card in worked finei suspect one or both is happening with this carda some cards are defective but it takes some usage for them to start failing to where the user noticesb for some reason this brand of card does not like certain devices like my samsung galaxy s3my guess is i got a lemon but i am not chancing it to getting another one and will just move on to another reputable brandyou get what you pay for may be applicable here but a lot of others did have success with this card so ymmv,1.0

great while it lastedi think i got 8 or 9 months out of this before it started to fail it is still working intermittently but my phone will suddenly stop being able to read it for no apparent reason designed for durability my foot it might survive in salt water but it did not survive in a phone that frankly does not get a whole lot of use this is the first sandisk product i have ever had fail on me it may still be under warranty but i do not care now that i have to replace it i am going to go with another brand,2.0
class 10 not recommended for smart phonesthis review is for the sandisk ultra 32 gb microsdhc class 10 uhs1 memory card with adapter sdsdqu032gaffpa that was purchased for me from amazonfrustrating in a word this card was reported by two different android phones as damaged but my windows computer recognized it with no issues if the card had nothing on it or had just been reformatted then the phones recognized it but as soon as data music or pictures were added then the phones reported the card as damaged i had this card returned to amazon after 3 days of sheer frustrationi read another review that suggested the class 10 cards were not ideal for smart phones i was already using a sandisk class 4 16gb card in another phone and had never had issues so i purchased a class 4 sandisk 32gb and it was as smooth as butter both phones recognized the card right away and added data music and pictures seamlessly and quickly the second card purchased was the sandisk microsdhc 32gb flash memory card black sdsdqm032gb35 retail packagingin summary this card may work just fine for other devices but based on the sheer number of other reviewers here on amazon and elsewhere on the internet that had similar issues with smartphones i cannot recommend this card for a smartphone,1.0

disappointed possible production problemi love sandisk and i have used quite a few of their products including an mp3 player a couple of usb keys and even a micro sd card class 4 i have never had any problems after installing this card however i have seen it unmounting itself randomly to be detected again and automatically being mounted by my galaxy s4 device this happens several times a day including when i am in the middle of watching a movie on the phone this is the first week that i have had the card this is unacceptable normally i would have just asked for a replacement but after doing some research online i have found out that this seems to be a recurrent problem on many phone models and does not seem to be just a dud but a production issue i have returned the card and i am going to go with another brand instead,1.0

6 months and my s4 is having problemsworked great for about six months in my s4 and last week it started having device connectivity issues the phone keeps saying ad card removed resetting the phone lets the memory card work for maybe 30 minutes very frustratingi have 30 gigs of media i would appreciate scan disk resolving this issue with me and the product,2.0

used for my samsung galaxy tab 2 70i used this for my samsung galaxy tab 2 70 like the others are saying it had to be formatted in fat 32 you can put your applications on your sd card with an application called link2sd you just have to partition the sd card in order to be able to use it whether you get this card or a smaller one you need one period for the tab 2 because you cannot do much without a wifi connection if you just have the internal memory and you want to download a lot of applications,5.0
true class 10 performancethere are a number of microsd manufacturers out there that offer large capacity cards like this they claim to be class 10 but when tested prove to be closer to class 6 cards in performance this sandisk card performs at the class 10 leveli use these cards in various devices that need class 10 speeds such as my android phone because of the data transfers i do for work and for the games i keep on itif your device does not need class 10 you are just using it for simple storage of basic files like docs or ebooks then you could probably save some money by going with class 6 if the prices are very close then you might as well spend the extra money and get class 10this card came with a nice plastic storage case and a sd adapter the only reason i gave this 4 stars is because i feel the prices should be a lot lower by now inventory is plentiful and these are not cutting edge tech any more,4.0
works well in htc one m8my only gripe is i wish it were a bit cheaper but you never need something like this when it is on sale,4.0
works great in my galaxy tab 2 70i needed the extra memory in my galaxy tab and this filled the bill at the right price i just wish you could load applications directly to this external memory card since the tab is limited with 8gb for operating system applications and so on this card is worth the cost,5.0
cannot beat this price for 32gbthis was purchased to capture video with a gopro hero3 and so far it has performed splendidly hd video takes up a ton of space but this card will still hold quite a bit of it downloading is pretty quick and easy thanks to class 10 speed,5.0

might mix of performance and valueive used this memory card in a couple of different devices and in both cases it is performed quite well it is an excellent mix between needing something that will be reliable and always work and needing something that does not cost an before midday and a leg i have had far too many of the cheap noname cards just stop working and this one has never done that,5.0

durable and sandisk is faster than sony cardsi accdientally dropped it in my garbage can and it got a tiny drop of water on it but it still worked perfectly sandisk cards are always faster read speed than sonys cards the competitor and this card is much cheaper than the competitors as well therefore i have no choice but to give this a 5 star and a serious recommendation,5.0

memory cardi returned to order a 116 laptop so i could have full operations than having a notebook i am sure this is good quality as i have purchased san disk numerous times,1.0
avoid this complete junkfortunately i got this as a lightning deal so it was not that expensive i purchased it in october but did not start using it on my samsung galaxy s3 until january it was fine until it was not it chose to die today just a little more than four months after i started using it i checked my phone this morning and it told me that the sd card had been unmounted i did not think much of it but when i rebooted my phone and was still unable to find the card i began to be concerned when i got home from work i put a different card in and it worked fine i tried to check the card on my computer and it could not be seen so the problem is definitely a card unfortunately i lost most of the pictures i have taken since getting this phone i know that i probably should have backed them up but i really did not expect the card to fail so quickly perhaps if i would read all of the one start posts before buying i would have oh well back to my 16gb amazon class 10 card until i can get a different onei am not even going to bother with a warranty claim i do not need another card that will fail after four months,1.0

the microsd card everive had this card for a couple months now and it is amazing i use it in my phone so i can put stuff in there rather then use the space on the phone its extremely responsive and extremely fast as well i had a sandisk class 4 microsd card and this flies past that easily usually when i would try playing music it would take a couple seconds to start but using this it starts instantaneous it was as if i had stored the music on the phone itself i dont know what else you might use this card for but if you are looking for a microsd for your phone look no further,5.0
good card for phoneunless your really stringent on form factor and negligible speed always get these with the adapter some phones do not transfer data that quickly and the adapter is a life saver always have it in my pc when dumping large files speed is actually a big improvement over the 32gb card,3.0

increased uploaddownload speedsthis thing definitely improved performance over the standard card transferring music videos and pictures seem so much more seemless than they were before prior to this card i had a 16gb standard microsd card that just felt like forever transferring data back and fourth from my phone i recommend this to anyone who uploads a lot of music and videos onto their mobile devices transfer rates make up for the slightly higher cost,5.0

be careful with thisi bought this for only one use to put in my samsung galaxy s3 i popped in the card mounted and formatted in settings and it works like a charm in the phone howeverit is in caps pay attention when i took it out of the phone and put the microsd into the sd adapter and plugged into the sd card slot on the front of my pcwin7 x64 it asked to format the cardwas already formatted by phone so was confused so i hit ok no biggie it was empty anyways windows did its thing and when it was ready to use it said the card was only 1mbit showed 5947gb in the phone so my troubleshooting section of mind kicked in and i removed the card and i just so happen to have a microsd slot in my computers frontal bay and it wouldnt even show it was connected in windows explorer so i took it out and put in another microsd card voila it read switched them out again and nothing so i decided to pull up my paragon hard disk utility and it showed the same thing as windows regardless how i tried formatting it i gave up and put it back in the phone and mounted itmy s3 said it neded to be formatted so i formatted it in the phone again and it showed just like it did the first time 5947gb i then proceeded to install samsung kies and got my phone hooked up to my pc via usb cable i opened the phone in windows explorer and right there it shows the phone memory at 16gb and the sd card at 5947 gbi am not quite sure whats going on with that because the sd slots in my pc read my other cards just fine but anyway i guess if you plan on using it in your phone or possibly other device exclusively because i can use it like a charm while it is in my phone otherwise it seems pretty useless so i guess just depends on what youre using it for on a side not be careful when you open the plastic package that contains the micro sd and sd adapter be sure to open it over a large clear area i opened it up the the living room with black tile floor and had to get a flashlight to find it when it jumped out on the holderit just sets in the little plastic holder so even the slightest shake will send it flying when opening i am giving it 35 on here but 55 if youre getting it for a phone galaxy s3 at least because it works fine in mine,4.0

a great addition to my playeri bought this specifically for my cowon j3 as it comes with 32gb of internal memory adding 64gb got me almost to 100gb that is 3x the original capacity that player hasthis card is formattable to fat32 thus allowing you to use it with some of the older sdhc devices i know not many of the buyers will even consider this ability but i figured i would throw it there for those that might be interestedthe card is fast i would post benchmarks but you can just google for a ton available already also with 30mbs speeds this wouldnt make a bad camera sd card if you absolutely needed one someday just stick it in the sd adapter and youre rollingi tested it with my canon t3i worked flawlessly however not as fast as my other 90mbs card,5.0

sandisk ultra 64 gb microsdxc class 10 huge capacity reliable fast sd cardthis chip holds way more than i would normally need but we were going on a three week trip and potentially taking about a million fotos if you need a large capacity this card was fast for the writes and reads for all the fotos i took the largest fotos were in the 1012 mb range but most were 57 mband there were at least 150 shots some were absolute crap but that is the great thing about digifotos the film is cheapi bought mine here for 5047 and that is still a good price i think for the ability to capture so many fotos and videos and data if you wish,5.0
extended the useful life of miss surface pro 128i own a first generation microsoft surface pro 128 and it has been a good machine but i was really finding it challenging working within the constraint of 128gb of storage space i had a 64gb class 10 sdxc card which worked well but was not going to fit the vmware virtual machine i wanted to run off the sd storage the virtual machine increases in size with regular use and the operating system i was running is recommended for at least 40gb of max storage to operate properly combined with the files i needed to store and 64gb memory chip was no longer sufficientthe sandisk ultra 128gb microsdxc class 10 memory card was able to handle that with ease however i have found that the virtual machine ran noticeably faster off the 64gb chip than this one i have actually ordered a second of these to see if i might have just received a flawed chip if the replacement chip offers improvement i will revise this review it provides its main selling point more storage at a relatively low cost so far has run reliably in my tablet computerif storage space is a significant issue for your device and the memory can make use of 128gb sdxc then i would recommend product,4.0
exactly what i orderedthis card is great for the price it is exactly what i ordered works great with my samsung s4 plenty of memory,5.0
works but read carefullythe card works well purchased 64 gb to use in my phone as that will store a lot of pix and tunes ah but the phone does not recognize the 64 and i can only use about half the memory,4.0
very happygreat price especially for the size and speed this maxed out my note 2 smartphone and i am very pleased with the speed of delivery and the cost,5.0
for the price you cannot go wrong64gb is pretty good size and in a cell phone it is awesome however getting it formatted as fat32 is not the easiest method by default windows 7 will not allow anything larger than 32gb to be formatted as fat32 even if you execute a dos command to format to fat32 it will fail there is a fix though ridgecrop consultants limited has a program that can be downloaded i would suggest that you support this free application by sending the guy a few bucks as he has truly written a great program that works very well in windows 7 i have used his program fat32format to successfully format this 64gb microsdxc disk i then copied all of my contents from my old 12gb disk to this one i inserted the disk into my phone and whalla it works great very pleased with this purchase,5.0

excellenti use this to hold all 22 gigs of my music on my galaxy s3 and i still have room for several seasons of a tv show definitely a great productthe only thing i can complain about is there is a one second gap between songs at least using google music i suppose that is the price you pay for this large of storage,5.0

so far so good on using this devicei have been using the device for couple weeks so far no issuethe writing speed is slow which might be the problem on my laptop not the card,5.0
once you get a proper sdxc reader 64gbwhile the class 10 speed is excellent it is amazing when files will initially transfer at 200mbs before settling down to 19 you do need to use a reader with proper sdxc support and manually format the card in a good partitioning program like minitools or easeus that alone should disqualify it from 5 stars for lack of userfriendliness but if it werent for that the fast roomy card is a wonder to own,4.0
this thing is speedy in my s4i cannot believe how fast this is i had a class 10 32gb card by imation and it was nothing like the speeds i get out of this,5.0

1 star reviews micro sdxc card unmounts itself in galaxy s4 solution found rma card faulty card instructions in reviewnote please read the last update scroll to the bottom i am leaving this review as 1 star as it appears to help others who purchased and had a similar experiencei give sandisk 5 stars for customer service and 1 star for the product for those manufactured in the past for those newly manufactured products that contain the software rom fix i would give the product 5 starsto all those who purchased this card due to all the great reviews and then used it in a galaxy s4 gs4 smartphone for storage the solution to the problem is not one you can solve without returning the card to sandisk for a replacement under warranty believe me i tried everything that the google searches returned as solutions formatting as exfat formatting in the gs4 then copying data to the card while in the phone and so on nothing worked and so now please stop pulling out your hair and hopefully you will get the same result which i hope to get soon just rmad and will send it back tomorrow for a free replacement under warrantythe problem as confirmed from the sandisk customer support rep when i asked specifically asked him when used in the gs4 this card will unmount itself inadvertently may be true only for cards manufactured before the rom patch described below was implemented in manufacturing this can cause the data to become corrupt luckily was not my experience and or can be very frustrating as most of us are saving 13 mp camera pictures to the card or mp4 movies that stop in the middle of the movie and it unmounts when you view the picture in the gallery or worse right when you take the picture this was the issue i experienced sandisk knows about this issue again sandisk knows about the issue and will replace your card call them info below and they will take care of it under warranty they have a good name for a reason and they want to keep it sorry sandisk about the 1 star but i thought it was the way to get the message out to those searching for a solution the customer rep told me that sandisk tried to work with samsung to resolve the issue but samsung refused to acknowledge a problem exists with this card and some of their phones especially their flagship gs4 phones the customer rep told me that to their knowledge the card works fine in regular cameras not samsung gs4 phones with cameras obviously and even worked fine in some phones from htc and so on that could accommodate the 64 gb cards hence the 5 star ratings from others the solution sandisk came up with was to write a patch into the rom of the card itself to specifically address the issue on samsung gs4 phones and maybe other samsung phones like the gs3 i was assured that the new card i would get would work flawlessly will see in about 3 weeks i purchased my card from amazon june 2013 so the ones currently being manufactured and the one i should get will have the new patch however as sandisk manufactures in batches like most of the industry old batches of unpatched cards obviously exist in warehouses i asked about a software patch i could download and was told it is not possible hence the hard coded patch in the cards romso how to take care of the problemafter speaking with the sandisk us customer support link and info below this is what i learned and didgo to the sandisk site1 2 call consumer products support this is the us no 1866sandisk 72634753 tell them that the card is unmounting itself in your gs4 i assume this is also a problem experienced by gs3 owners too4 they will then confirm your information approve your return 1015 min approval window by mine was basically instantaneously and then send you emails with a ups return label and instructions5 by the way they also asked if i had a magnifying glass to id the serial no on the card but i did not and could not read it myself those numbers are super small printed into the plastic do not believe me take a look yourself i told the rep i could not read them and he said no problem they would process without the serial no i assume this is because they send you a new replacement card only when they receive your card you send in makes sensewell that is it problem hopefully solved let us see in 23 weeks the rep was super nice about it and seemed like they were all too familiar with the problem kudos to sandisk for taking care of it however it would be nice if there was some type of communication notice of the issue besides google info sources forums and so on i spent hours maybe a couple of days total hours worth thinking it was an issue with my phone my data transfer oh well that is how it goesi really hope that this review helps some of you out there with the same problem as me good luckby the way i would give the card 5 stars if this problem was solved in the patched rom of newer cards as the data transfer speeds are awesome on the card tested transferring data via a card reader hooked to my computer if the data transfer remaining mounted in the gs4 issue never existed prepatch of rom of courseupdate 08172013 all went well with the return of the sandisk storage card ups shipping took about 2 days from when i sent it sandisk verified the warranty claim 1 day later and 5 hours later that same day my replacement card had been shipped waiting on the new card now but expect to test it out very soon early next week will update the post after testing out the new card just as a reference i have been using a 32gb micro sd hc sandisk card in the gs4 since having shipped the 64gb card obviously it is a different card and not the micro sd xc kind other than a bit slower access speeds to the card absolutely zero problems well if you do not count that it is basically filled up hence why the 64gb option is great on the gs4 so it proves the point on the problem with the early build micro sd xc 64gb cardsi am happy to see that my review has helped some others out there good luck to you in your warranty claim my experience with sandisk customer support has been excellent so farupdate 08212013 received the new replacement sandisk storage card just a few days ago shipping back to me once they agreed it was defective was a very short time window have had it running in the galaxy s4 for a few days now without any jumps stutters or card unloading in the middle of picture or video taking card seems to work flawlessly as the sandisk rep mentioned it would one would think it is such a short time to test after a few days of use but if this were not fixed already it would have dismounted in the first 45 minutes that is how often and how fast it was occurring so it would seem the problem is solved the new sd card makes the phone even more responsive when moving between pictures in the gallery and performing other tasks like copying files to the card thanks sandisk unless i update this review by next week you will know that the problem has been fixedgood luck to those with similar problems as we now know how to get it fixed thanks to sandisks great responsive customer serviceupdate 08312013 this is the last update to this review just to close the loop the new replacement card from sandisk has been running flawlessly for about 2 weeks now i have not experienced any of the initial problems sandisk really did fix the issues in the new batch of cardsupdate 12092013 the card has been running in my gs4 flawlessly since replacing it around aug 21st pretty good track record so far 35 months so it appears to be fixed with the newly manufactured replacement cardsfor those that have left comments that i should change the rating upwards now that the issue is fixed see my addition at the beginning of this review when searching for a solution to a problem with a purchased product most people start at the 1 star reviews to see what others have experienced this is especially true for products with a lot of reviews this is what i did in the beginning with this product therefore i think leaving it at 1 star and adding the comments at the beginning should clarify the reviewthanks to review commenter da shocker for his input i think he sums it up very well when it comes to the value of files stored on media like thisone more thing to those not happy with the one star rating by this person go ahead buy one take tons of pics vids and save some music on there then when the card crashes come back and give it a five star a card cost 50100 pictures from a vacation or family event are priceless,1.0
hard to beatgot this microdata card for a digital camera that shoots in hd it came with a class 4 card but the video clips were blocky i had a class 6 and tested it in the camera with some improvement and at the advice of youtuber techmoan this guy does the best tech reviews on the web i ordered this class 10 card it solved the blocky issue and is a great value for the money,5.0

great card for the price fasti purchased this for a cheap android tablet i figured i would try a cheap tablet first and if i decided i wanted to go with an android tablet i would get something good later but either way the memory card will be used in one item or another so i wanted to get a good one like any other sandisk product i have purchased this card is topnotch comes with the in my opinion necessary sd card adapter class 10 speed really makes a difference when you have the card filled with musicmoviesapplications,5.0
great capacity on sony action cami bought this for my sony action cam at 720p30fps i get 11 hrs of recording which is awesome this card is more than fast enough for that cam the price was great too it comes with the regular sd card adapter so do not worry about buying one in addition the packaging can be difficult to get into though,5.0
works well but breaks easilyive had this card for about a year and i have been very careful with it and it just broke when i popped it out of sd card slot on my phone but it was very reliable card when it was not broken,3.0

1st died after 2 months 2nd going strongnever had a problem with any sd cards prior and always had a good track record with sandisk productscard was working great at first used exclusively in my samsung galaxy s3 enjoyed the extra spacegot the 32gb card and transfers were pretty quick i started to see about a month ago that the phone would randomly give me sd card unexpectedly removed error maybe once a week the last 2 weeks i also started seeing frequently sd card safe to remove randomly pop up at least once a day as well as the unexpected removal error every few days today the card stopped reading all togetherthe card was first inserted w the phone off when i bought it although i never formatted it it worked properly i also never removed the card from the phone in order to possibly corrupt it from improper removal so the card just seems to have died of it is own accord i never thought to check it is temperature after transferring large files so i am not sure if i had the same issue as another reviewercontacted sandisk waiting for reply if they replace the card and it works well i will revise this reviewupdate 22813got a replacement card after about a week and a half sandisk supplied a shipping label for me which is always a plus i have had the replacement in my s3 for 35 months now and still going strong i have also used it with the adapter in my gopro card is working well and hopefully it continues to do so updated to 4 stars since i have not had a single problem with this card the first one started showing issues fairly soon after installing maybe there was just a bad batch of the card for spell there,4.0
works as expecteddecent price on 16 gb works as it should no problems not sure if the speeds actually matter with mobile devices maybe for transferring media to pc faster actually helps either way it works great,5.0
love thisthis is my second time to buy this product and will give it as a gift to my friend packaging is nice and received in good condition,5.0
i got a rockthe 64gb card i purchased actually contains 4gb of flash memory and some kind of hack that causes it to appear as a 64gb drive in various drives and readers of course this took me a while to figure out since i only just got around to copying more than 4gb of data to the card but with some testing i have nonetheless discovered this to be the casethe card i bought was in amazon frustration free packaging i do not know if cards purchased that way are less likely to be counterfeit than retail packaged versions but i suspect that i will stick with manufacturer packaging from now on,1.0
seems to be junki have purchased 2 of these cards i have attempted to use them in my gopro herohd samsung galaxy s4 asus tf700 and in all of them they end up corrupting out of the blue with no warning i then have to perform a deep recovery to get the files i will never buy these ultra models again,1.0
failed after a few monthshad to send it back to sandisk they did replace it at no cost which is nice but still if i had lost a bunch of data i would have been pretty bummed i used it in my phone to store music one day i turned on my phone and it said cannot read card that was it i tried putting it in my computer to reformat was not even recognized as a drive at all,3.0

fast card claims class 10while sandisks packaging makes much mention of android phones and tablets there is nothing androidspecific about this microsdhc card i bought the 32gb version to use in an automotive dashcam where it works perfectlythe packaging also says that an android application is included suggesting it is preinstalled on the card but the very fine print on the back says you have to download it unlike another sandisk flash product i got recently there was no bloatware preinstalled on the cardi like that this card is also said to be resistant to temperature extremes important to me as it will be behind a car windshield and will get hot at times,5.0
works greatused this in my gopro camera works great,5.0
worked for 3 months just long enough to make it past the 90 day amazon return policyim so disappointed in sandisk i bought this for my galaxy s3 phone worked great for the first few months suddenly i noticed some pictures were missing then it kept giving me an error that the sd card has unexpectedly stopped working then i tried popping out the card and popping it back in now it says unrecognizable files and it asks to format the mp3s i had bought and stored on the microsd card in a pinch just to see if this would fix my issues i formatted the disc now i lost everything and it is still giving me issues read some similar issues from other customers now i am regretting my purchase save your money and headaches and buy something else,1.0

microsd that also works as standard sdwith most of the worlds electronic devices finally standardizing to sd thank you sony for finally adopting this standard it seems most things we own work on either the microsd or regular sd card that is why this little package is so handy you get both in one neat little package and at 64gb youll have plenty of space to store most of your programs files and so on on your devicethe class 10 rating ability to move data onoff card at the current maximum speed is a must for anyone that does not want to sit for vital seconds waiting for data to write to the card and sandisk has proven themselves over the years as making a quality product sure you may occasionally find a dud in their inventory but they are quick to fixreplace it and that is what matters most buying cheaper cards will land you with a readwrite error when you can least afford it do not be the person that loses those important family photos or that document that is due today because of a cheap and defective cardi purchased this particular card for my asus transformer as it fits nicely into the pad itself and with the optional keyboard attachment which is capable of holding standard sd cards it fits there as well making this the perfect solution for my extra memory needs and at a much better bargain than most competitors you can certainly purchase more internal memory on your iproduct or android device most seem to have 16gb or 32gb variants but why spend the extra cash for 16gb extra when you can buy far more in an external card,5.0
defective within a month but amazon replaced fastgot this card in early january for my samsung tab2 101 tablet within a couple of weeks it was loading music files incorrectly onto the card i did not know what was wrong but finally thought i would format card again to see if that would correct the problem card would not quick format or format slowly as always amazon is taking care of the problem and i will have replacement card within 24 hours hope the replacement is more reliable i am just writing it off as a fluke as i have never had a problem with a sandisk product in the past21413 when i called amazon they replaced it to my door within 24 hours replacement works fine now that is great service,4.0
reasonable pricei used to use an 8gb one and i recently upgraded to this one as i have bigger need put it into my mobile as soon as i got it and it works well quite easy to use and i use it for storing all my music pictures on my mobile and sometimes upload movies when i go on long drives sandisk is a great brand and its definitely worth it,5.0
warning some cards have manufacturer defectapril 2013 i have had the card for about 4 months and seemed to work fine i use it to store additional files on my ultrabook as the solid state drive is small only 128gb about a month ago the card could not be recognized it only lasted about 2 hours so i thought maybe just a momentary blip however this weekened it cannot be recognized at all and it has been 3 days sandisk support is not available until the week so i will update on tech support soon however i did find that the sandisk indicated there was a defect with some of these cards i assume they will replace it but i have lost lots of hours and a lot of pictures so i am really bummed and frustratedfrom sandisk sandisk has been made aware of potential product issues involving a very small percentage of its 32gb and 64gb sandisk mobile ultra microsd cards under certain circumstances the cards may lock up and the card becomes inaccessible the issue has been identified and a manufacturing fix has already been put in place sandisk stands behind its products and any customer who experiences this issue with the microsd cards cards is asked to contact the sandisk support center for a resolution immediately sandisk,1.0

2 out of 5 cards defective so fari ordered these cards at a great price during black friday weekweekend i began loading some files music videos pics and so on the first card worked without any problems the second card started giving me cyclic redundancy errors at first i thought it was my hard drive that was failing and tried to copy the same files to a flash drive which worked just fine ok maybe i received a dud and tried with another card from my purchase same results cyclic redundancy error i started searching online and found a utility via one of the reviews on amazon called h2testw ran the test on both cards and it reported errors it also reported write speed of only 4mbsec which is way below advertised speeds these items were in retail packaging and i remember reading about the bulk package items being fakes i guess the retail package cards are not any betteri should have waited to do the refund because now i have to process the refund seperately i will test another card to see if i have better luck i wanted to leave a 1 star but i gave 2 stars since 1 card worked so far i have 2 more to testvery dissapointed because i was a fan of the sandisk ultra series for being reliable but i guess they are cheaping out on quality to increase their profit i would have been extremely upset if i used these cards for anything important,2.0
i am glad with this cardi a using this card with a sansa sandisk mp3 player and it is working flawless i am glad but i cannot imagine what could go wrong with a card like this either it works or it does not and mine is working anyway i would buy one of these again without a doubt,5.0
never can have enough memoryit does not hurt to have more memory than it does to have too little i have been using sandisk brand for some time now so i can say for my self that they are pretty reliable let us just hope i did not jinx myself,5.0
works fine in my galaxy s5its hard for me to evaluate this product in detail but i can report that it works just in my samsung galaxy s5 i turned the phone off probably much better to insertremove cards with the phone turned off and then slid the card into the slot inside the back of the phone when i turned the phone back on there was no obvious indication that i had made any changes at all however when i started to take photos the camera reported that it would now be storing pictures on the card instead of the phones internal flash memory so everything seems to work well,5.0
works greatthis product is the only one i had bought like this that has worked will recommend to all family and friends,5.0
works well with samsung gs4i purchased two of these for my wifes and my phone weve had no issues whatsoever with formatting and placing files onto this card you really cannot go wrong with this purchase except if the price is a bit too much,5.0
great cardi got two of these cards for under 40ea on small business saturday and it was worth every penny the card is fast i use it in my note 2galaxy s4 and i play music while takingsending pictures constantly as well as writing s notes with no lag or stutter at all this automatically gives you enough storage for whatever you should need no need to ever buy a phone with the most memory because a 16gb version or whatever the lowest version available is can instantly have 64gb just make sure it has expandable memory sandisk may have won me over since i always bought samsungkingston memory would definitely buy this again,5.0

fantastican excellent microsd card from sandisk i purchased this to format fat32 for use with mysamsung galaxy tab 3 7inch whiteand once so formatted works flawlessly it never has unmounted on its own it is lightning fast it is reliable and offers plenty of storage reasonably priced as well in fact i purchased this on sale at my local bigbox blue retailer with the yellow price tag for a logo for 2799,5.0

ok with my samsung galaxy s3ok so far with my samsung galaxy s3 i initially received one that seemed to have an issue it would intermittently save a photo here and there that would become corrupt a short time later the dropbox auto upload was fine so i know it was stored ok initiallyamazon excellent support quickly shipped out a new one the replacement has been working great so far no sign of the issue i had with the first onethe only con is the time to display contents and read it in mtp mode if it has a lot of files this is not the fault of the card it is a known issue with phones in mtp modenote to rooted gs3 usersi also tried putting the phone in the old unmounted usb mode i was unable to read it but was able to read a 32gb version of the same card it appears the gs3 does not support over 32gb in the old usb mode possibly part of the reason why they did not include a usb option via phone settings,5.0

it is pretty quicki have used this with a gopro camera and a faster flash card reduces the amount of rolling shutteri cannot say anything bad about it,5.0
perfect with gopro black 3so i got this sd specifically for my gopro black 3 simply hoping it would work since the gopro manual says use cards up to 64gb and the sandisk says it is good for cell phones and tablets yet does not mention the goprowell turns out it works perfect and although i have not tried it on other devices i think if it works flawlessly on the gopro it will work even better on anything elseso at first i thought maybe since it is only 30mbps there may be frame rate issues with recording even though i knew that should not be the case well after popping it in the gopro says 9hr14min 1080p super view video which is insane i put it on my helmet and took it for a spin when i came home after spending the day on the bike the hd quality was spectacular granted it is all thanks to the camera itself but it was smooth with zero frame rate issues the only flaw is the semi long time it takes to copy files to your hard drive as it copies at only 30mbps but honestly that is really no big deal and totally worth it stillbottom line this sd plus the gopro 3 is the best camera combination for your moneyps it is small simple durable and has no lock feature which i always found to be an annoyance anywayany questions please feel free to comment and i will do my best to answer,5.0

worksanother necessity for the gopros that i feel should at least come with the gopros at least a smaller gb to get you recording right out of the box too afraid to purchase an offbrand in fear of it not being compatible with the camera,4.0
awesome cardwhile i got this card as a deal of the day on amazon i would gladly pay 79 for itwith that said there has been some skepticism related to the serial number of the card as it is displayed on amazon i can confirm that i received a brand new 64 gb card with the serial sdsdqua064gu46a the packaging of the card says that it is a class 10 uhs speed class 1 after formatting copying over 20 gb of data from my evo 3ds previous card i get write speeds of about 9 mbs and read speeds of about 20 mbs i am fine with this and can not complain because i do not believe the evo 3d is intended to be compatible with sdxc cards however it does work just fine,5.0

not good for galaxy phonesi purchased this product knowing there might be an issue with the galaxy s4 this card worked for a week or two then began to spontaneously unmount and would mount itself back in the unmount periods began to become longer than a few hours days i tried this card in a galaxy note 2 still with the same result i attempted to contact sandisk customer service and utilize the warranty they know of the problem and began the exchange process then instructed me to wait for a mailing label that never came i called back and was told that they would reemail it to me to this day i am still waiting for that email i have never had this issue with this company but with ever changing technology it is what it is right i know this card will be good for some device i have if you own a galaxy phone beware i have not attempted to use this in a samsung tablet so on that i cannot review,1.0

poorly madewhen i got this memory card noticed the writr protect lever was hard to move instead of just sending it back i tried to meve it and the mdmory card broke on hslti hanve many sndisk cards and havd had no troible with them i guess i just got one that missed wuslity conttol on the linedont want to buy another but what do you do,1.0
fastonce you cut and pry your way through sandisks packaging you will be rewarded with a nicelymade and highperforming microsd uhs1 flash memory it comes formatted to sdorgs standards in fat32 so it is ready to go for most applications my single gripe about this product is that they have omitted the usual small plastic box that holds the card and adapter i use those since i frequently switch cards between uses and frequently have them in storage those little boxes are very useful it is way too easy to lose a microsdanyway here are the results from atto disk benchmarksettings anticipating digicam use total length 64mb overlapped io and qd4 but it never exceeds 1segment size in kbytes readwrite in kbytesecsize write read5 9904 163431 145 170332 13454 273244 14194 353378 15065 3985316 14154 4062932 14277 4295764 13212 44291128 17567 44247256 16209 42512 15391 421024 17408 422048 16229 42sorry for the ugly table amazon does not support consecutive spaces including alt255 or embedded tabsthis is very fast for a microsd it is not quite up to what sandisk achieves in full size uhs1 sd cards that can write over twice this speed but those are electronically more complex cards the micro form factor likely does not permit the additional hardware to achieve speeds comparable to the larger cards note that the read speed is a lot faster than what sandisk promises note also that you will not achieve these speeds with a usb2 reader you will need either a usb3 or builtin pcie reader to get accurate results so do not complain to me if you use a usb2 reader and do not achieve these speedsin any event youd be hardpressed to find anything fastermy personal experience with sandisk products is very good that is i have never had anything fail on me given the very reasonable prices of these i rate them as highly recommended,5.0

time to shop kingstoni bought this on october 9th and did not start using it for about a week after i received it on the 11th well two days ago it died a quick death i cannot even format it so after all these years of buying sandisk products i guess i will give in and start paying a little more for kingston it seems as though sandisk is getting to be a cheaply built product you would think that a product this small and inexpensive would be able to be replaced without cost within the first 90 days but that is my fault for not reading the fine print so lesson learned buy it right and buy it once so go with something else,1.0

sd card always unexpectedly unmounts and remountsas the title says the card i got is defective and faulty the issue is the sd card always unmounts and then remounts and sometimes it will says the the sd card is corrupted and needs to be formatted so first i tried to format it using my cellphone xperia play copied all my files again to the sd card and it gave me the same error tried 2 other phones inspire 3g and samsung galaxy s4 still same error then i tried to take it out and put it in my computer and manually format and check for bad sectors and fix errors and it will not finish and says cannot continue because sd card is corrupted i searched google and find out the sandisk have shipped a bad batch of sd cards so i contacted the company and demanded for a return because its past due to return it through amazon got rmaed and already shipped it and i do not know how long will it take to for them to send me another sd card so now i do now have any sd card to put my files because of this situations that could have avoided if sandisks qa department is not slacking off very disappointed customer,1.0

it is memory it is fast what do you needdo you need memory this is 32gb of it in a microsdhc package if that is the format you need and if this is selling at a price you like then just get it and get on with your day youve probably got better things like that old episode of gunsmoke youve been meaning to get to or a nice walk along a cliff face possibly even something else the point is that memory shopping should not take you a long time you should just do it the amount of time it is taken you to read this is way more time than one should ever have to invest in considering a memory purchase have a lovely midtolatemorning whenever that might next occur in your vicinity cheers,5.0

does the jobat the time of writing this review i bought three of these memory cards in last couple of weeks for work related phones they work fine in the samsung galaxy s3 mini phones we are happy with the read and write speeds one small note of caution the price that can be paid for these can vary so please check around and save a few extra dollars when installed you will not get the full 32gb from the sd card but that is to be expected so please bear this mind,4.0

if amazon was a chick i would take her to dinner and a moviepros1 ordered it and got free shipping2 got it in 3 days3 popped it out of the box4 popped it in the cellphone5 donecons1 does not come with a hot pocket2 amazon would not marry me3 took me too long to order the hell was i thinking4 took too long to get it out of the box 1 secondupdateokay i have to bring this rating down to 1 star my 64gb sd card just crapped out i am getting the 0x80071ac3 code and i cant format it or copy files to it i ran scan disk and nothing works i do not know if i will be buying any more sd cards again from them luckily i was able to save all my files i have goggled this problem and this is a common problem with these cards,1.0
great support from sandisk large cards not recommendedwhile out and about in a photo shoot i had this card fail on me luckily i am a backup freak and was just starting out for the day so i only lost a few pictures card completely died and had to be sent back to sandisk for a replacementthe whole process took a little over a week and communication was excellent so 5 stars on sandisk supporti know about memory so i always have multiple cards available and if i am out for an extended time spread my work out over cards to minimize riskwhat about the average person who throws all their data on this disk and looses precious memories sure they are at fault for not backing up their data unless you are shooting hd videos though chances are youre not going to fill this card up in a dayunless you either need the storage for hd video or something or your data is not important i would say it makes more sense to just get several 16gb cards equaling 64gb at roughly the same or less price depending on brandagain sandisk support was great and they even asked if i needed data retrieved i cannot recommend this card though,2.0
good pricegood price works as expected nothing much more to say abt a microsd card honestly the frustration free packaging is really good definitely better than the retail packaging,3.0
failed within a few daysi hope you have better luck it has gotten a lot of great reviews but first the sticker covering the contacts on the back fell off then the card died completely hopefully it is an isolated incident but i am trying a different brand in case its a bad batch,1.0

awesomeas soon as i got the card i popped it into my phone and starting piling my music onto it but then i noticed 900 kbs transfer speed i thought i got a class 10 turns out the device the card is mounted in has a factor on write speed i plugged the card into the included sd card adapter and used a different reader and it was capping at 6 mbs so i am pretty happyone thing though you do not get 32gb of usable space with this card or any other card for that matter you get around 29gb with this card in particular it is normal do not worry,5.0

awesomeworks as intended i use it with my old sansa mp3 playerand i have another one which is used with my samsung galaxy player 50 android tablet and they both work fine on both devices after being formatted by the android tablet i am planning to buy more now since i am an anime junkieand anime junkies need their space laughing out loud,5.0
works but beware exfat32maybe there is nothing that can be done and it is just the way the technology is at this time but to me it seems that the 64gb sd cards have very limited uses at this time because they are formatted in whats called exfat32 instead of the standard fat32 to get 64gb from a 32gb card after receiving my card and inserting it into my new android tablet with jelly bean it was recognized and it did show i had 59gb available i then removed the card from the tablet and inserted it into my computers a win7 and a vista and tried to transfer files photos and videos from my laptop to the card they would not transfer after some research on the internet it appeared that the card had to be reformatted from the new exfat32 to the standard fat32 all my files were created in win xp and win vista fat32 i also have a win7 machine i recently purchased and can easily move all types of files between all the machines and memory cards and flash drives but could not transfer any files to this card from any computer as long as the card was formatted in exfat32 i had read on the internet about reformatting the cards and it working my win7 machine does not even have the option to format to standard fat32 it only has nstf and exfat32 my older computers have the older fat32 format option and it took my vista computer with a dual core processor 1 hours to reformat the card to fat32 after reformatting i was able to easily transfer my files photos and videos on my xp and vista computers but not the win7 computer the card works in my tablet and i am able to access and use all the files i transferred to the card in fat32 with my vista computer on the tablet but after reformatting it now the card only has 27gb of space available so it was essentially reformatted the 64gb card into a 32gb card i will keep the card because i have a lot of work into it reformatting and transferring files and hopefully in the future i can reformat it again back to exfat32 if and when exfat32 catches on and an os is made that can seamlessly use files created in both fat32 and exfat32 this seems to be a good card that works well in certain situations but my advice do your research on what you have and how you will use the card because this is not simply a big gb card that can be used for everything in every device unless all your files photos and videos are in or will be created with exfat32 there are some real draw backs to this card and you might be better off just buying multiple lower gb cards if you really need this much storage space in a micro sd card or perhaps cards you already own can be reformatted into exfat32 and double the capacity if your computer has the exfat32 reformat option i have not tried it but based on my experience the last few days it seems like it would work if exfat32 works for you i gave 3 stars because it does work but i feel sandisk not fully explaining how they are getting 64gb out of this card and the possible problems a consumer might have with it is misleading advertising,3.0
nice storagemy wife just loves taking pictures on her galaxy s4 and was filling up the internal memory popped this baby in and now she has tons more room always a good idea to keep your pics on an external just in case the phone crashes that your pictures are saved too bad apple does not offer that feature,5.0

works greati added this sandisk ultra 32 gb microsdhc to my smartphone and it works perfectly although i would not say that i love the memory card i will say that i have no complaints about it and i am perfectly happy with it,5.0
good valuefound this card at a reasonable price on amazon and purchased to replace a severalyearold 16g noname card that passed away have no issues so far and being a sandisc expect many years of use in my smartphone 32g size allows for plenty of media space without clogging up phones internal memory,5.0
not so great for galaxy s4i bought this card excited to expand the 16gb of storage that come with the phone however this card had issues mounting when i would start the phone after some research it looks like sandisk had a large batch of bad cards if formatted as fat32 the issue rarely occurred but when formatted as exfat like is ideal for mobile devices it would happen every time the phone was reset take caution with these cards the bad batch should be over i have read but if looking to use in a samsung phone maybe considering buying a different type of card as this is the only brand i have seen with issues other than that it is a good card with great size,3.0
works just finepurchased this to expand the memory of my unit and it is operating just the way i needed it to work,5.0

failed completely after about a monthworked fine for a month and then after about a month the phone did not see the card any more tried to read it on several pcs and none of them detected the card unfortunately it had not been backed up so all pictures and videos take on the phone are now gone,1.0
maximize your mobile device for minimal expensei own the samsung galaxy note 2 smartphone and besides having a userreplaceable battery this device also allows the user to pop in a micro sd card more is better too much is almost enough and hence the 64gb model which permits storing insane numbers of songs on your phone in my case over 70 three of the songs are great 2 are ok and the rest not so good seriously this is a must own if your smart phone is not made by apple if you own the iphone not so great there are no useraccessible batteries or micro sd cards in iphones if you own android well life will be considerably brighter once you pop this in which took all of like 30 seconds you do not need to format it unless you wish to erase what youve already put on it highly recommend sandisk is a trusted provider of flash memory devices and buying from amazoncom is a nobrainer,5.0
reliable and fastvery very good and reliable use it in my win8 tablet so i do not take it out a lot but when i do it seems to work fine in other places i bought it a while ago and it is never failed i would recommend it,5.0
unexpectedly removedi bought this for my samsung galaxy s4 i do not know if it is my phone or the card but my phone says it was unexpectedly removed from time to time my wifes phone does not do it as often but still does it very fast but unreliable i have had many sandisk before and this is the only one i have had problems with i have read that there were some that were poorly made thinking i will send it back and give it another chance,2.0

so so quality at a cheap pricei am only giving this product 3 stars becuse i purchased this one as a replacement for a sandisk micro sd card that kept having problems with i finally got tired of losing my data and ponied up the 20 odd dollars to just replace the darn thing,3.0
works great note 3 i have room whoo hokay i am a memory hog i admit itthe note 3 has 32gb internal storage and it is nearly full i had a 64gb microsd card in it and guess what 15gb left so whats a geek to dobuy this wow what breathing room i have and then some i copied the entire 64gb card to the 128gb card and then added more hd movies in addition to the phones stuff i have all 6 star wars movies the back to the future trilogy and the indiana jones movies on this card and room for plenty more no doubt when the note 4 comes out i will be ready with a kickbutt memory cardthe note 3s specs state that it will accept cards up to 64gb well at the time 64 was the highest card available so they could not possibly test for a higher capacity phandroid android forums however has a fairly comprehensive list of devices that are compatible with this card accurate to the date of the articleso i am a happy camper yes i paid a premium for being an early adopter but i will be saving my pennies for the inevitable black friday sale in november which will be just about the time the note 4 is released folks i cannot recommend this card enough just make sure youre backing up to a pc regularly if it does fail you definitely want your precious pics and data backed up,5.0
works great but there is a trick to itworks but there is a trick to it so i purchase a lenovo yoga 10 tablet and installed the card and it told me the card was damaged i put the card in my pc and it worked fine i even reformatted it in the pc still no luck called lenovo and they walked me through formatting it again in the pc and still did not work but there was an option in the android software that is a status screen pull down from the top of the screen and that gave me a choice to let me format it in the tablet and after it completed it i was good to go it mounted and i downloaded my 318 songs on it and it is working like a charm only thing i can think of is that android does not like the way sandisk formats their cards i think if everyone knew about this there would be a lot less returns,5.0
works like advertisedthis product was formatted and installed in a gopro hero 3 black i get 430 hours of recording time on 1080p 60fps no issues so far and do not expect any since sandisk is basically the standard for solid state memory,5.0

works great in an evo 4g ltebought this for my htc evo 4g lte it works great i knew in order to use such a big card it had to be a class 10 and i only trust sandisk samsung or kingston with my memory cards this one works well it did take about a day for the bugs to be ironed out and let the evo find its paths back to its files this is a very good stick at a very good price the first one i got from amazon was damaged they quickly replaced it with one that was lost by fedex i called up about a week later and they overnighted a new one and paid for weekend ups delivery i was amazed at the service from amazon on thisallinall it does not get much better than sandisk for memory and amazon for the place of purchase do not hesitate to buy this card for your high end phone i know for a fact that the htc evo lte galaxy s3 can run this card,5.0
one word junki have not had many problems with what i have bought over the years but when i do i will make sure to warn others i loaded a handful of videos from my pc and then installed this in my android tablet for a trip corrupted nothing worked and sometimes it can be seen other times it does not even show up the tablet wants to format it which it has never been able to do successfully and needless to say it is too small to even be a paperweight the sd adapter that it came with was also junk and upon the first time i went to use it it simply did not feel right so i used my trusty lexar micro sd to usb that came with my lexar 32gb micro sd cardi would have expected more and unfortunately as it stands many people have success with them working and equally those that do not i have even formatted it to see if it made any difference and there was none and of course my window of return is gone so unless the seller stands behind it it is going in the trash i knew i should have gone with what i had purchased before as i have three of them working perfectly for over a year moreover what is even a bigger disappointment is that our camera that uses a standard sd card and it is a noname with no identifying marks has worked for two years without a problemi do know problems arise but when the cost of a product goes up and up and the quality control goes down i am not going to be the one accepting those terms if youre looking for a good card search amazon for this one lsdmi32gbsbnar this is the lexar and i have thousands of pictures video clips and it has even endured three updates to my phone plus i carry my phone everyday so it is subject to everyday life all the time it has been tough stuff,1.0

the only thing better than this would be a 256gb card and a better pricei ordered this before amazon fixed their price and it cost 199 usd the product is great however it is over priced at 199 i think their 128gb thumb drives go for about 79 usb and were on sale at brick and mortar stores for 69 last weekthis is a product that should have been released at least 24 months ago and sandisk is a company that likes to drag its feet and squeeze people with older cards like the 64gb cardsall i can say is where are the 256gb 512gb 1tb and 2tb micro sdxc uhsi or uhsii cards they all use the exfat file system i have tested my gs3 gs4 note 3 and note pro 122 with this card and all of them read it just fine,5.0

large capacity medium wallet hitstorage prices will always go down though i would not say at what rate over what interval of time a la moores law i am not that smart at the time i purchased it it was a very good price for this amount of memory in a years time it will probably be a laughably expensive sum for a pittance of storage oh wellwith it in my phone i do not have to worry about the number of photos or the duration of video i take,4.0
does not workpicked this up on sale does not work only shows up as a 1mb yes megabyte card that i cand do anything with i already threw away the original packaging too i am sure returning it is going to be a huge pita because of thatupdate after writing this albeit short review i found this is not uncommon i also found that this card was deliberately crippled despite the product description saying the sandisk ultra microsdxc uhsi card works with any microsdxc compatible device that was all the motivation i needed to process a return on it rather than having it replaced,1.0

no problems in galaxy s2 and evo 3di bought three of these and all three worked upon initial installation with no formatting using my notebook computers built in sd card reader i saw transfer speeds between 6 mb writing and 14 mb reading this was doing a simple copy past of all files on my old card that i had saved to my computer these speeds are much slower than the stated maximum by the card manufacturer but would be expected with over 120 small files like my example the read write times were close to 50 faster than those of my old 8 gb class 10 sandisk micro sd card so there is definitely a performance gain with this updated cardall things considered 16 gb of storage on a class 10 card from the leading manufacturer and at 15 is a steal i highly recommend this card,5.0

holy crapi bought this for a galaxy note 80 and while it functions properly it is completely useless for my tablet i cannot put movies or books on it because they are streamed from google play and i cannot put applications on it because that is not allowed why do they put a micro sd slot on a tablet that cannot use it for anything but backups backups i might add that are already in the cloud amazon did a great job delivering it which was a bright spot in the realization that i spent 25 dollars on a chip that is going to do a better job cleaning the dirt out of my grout than helping the memory on my tablet,3.0

very good card lots of memory and fastthis works well with my samsung galaxy stratosphere ii it has a lot of storage space good for all your videos music and pictures it comes with an adapter so if you wanted you could use it in a spot for a regular sd card but it really is meant for use in a voice or data recorder a camcorder or phone it is class 10 so it handles recording and playback of hd quality video which is important as newer phones can record that way very good card,5.0

san disk 64 gb micro sd cardusing this in my samsung g3 cell phone as a memory card and expansion it works ok for now allthough not the card but the phone itself does have a slight issue with reading massive sd cards at this high compacity i hope that samsung will release a software or firmware update to resolve the issue with reading the card on boot up of the phone sometimes i have found that simply restarting the phone usually resolves the issue with reading the card or any other error messages overall minus the slight issues it works great,4.0

designed incompatibilitydo not support sandiskhii ordered two card and they arrived the next day even faster than prime unfortunatey this 64gb microsd card is designed to only work with exfat if youre an exfat fan and do not ever plan to change this is the card for you i have been able to take all of the previous 64gb microsd cards i have ordered put them in an adapter and format them in my windows 7 desktop i am a ntsf fan and find it to be much more stable in tabletswith other cards that are not intentionally crippled i can format the card to ntsf on monday exfat on tuesday fat32 on wednesday it is exfat or the highway for sandiskyou can use easeus partition master to format the card to fat32 for devices such as cameras and mp3 players and many many many others that do not support exfat that being said you only get one shot once it is formatted into fat32 attempting to format back to exfat or ntsf hoses the card i could not reformat to ntsf no matter what i tried once again do not bother trying to format in your computer exfat is the only choiceany card that needs a special utility to format to anything other than exfat should not be supported do not buy it it is designed to failshame on you sandiskupdate 92412i spoke with sandisk technical support and they confirmed that sandisk ultra 64gb microsd cards are not compatible with android 40 and above this would be for class 10 sandisk ultra 64 gb microsdxc class 10 uhs1 memory card 30mbs with adapter sdsdqua064gu46a as well as sandisk 64gb mobile ultra microsdxc class 10 uhs1 30mbs memory card with sd adapter new version retail packaging with komputerbay sdxc usb readeri did not have any success formatting the class 10 card with easeus partition master sandisk recommended the free utility hpusbdiskexe and i successfully downloaded it from softpedia i was unable to format the card with ntsf but successfully converted one of the cards to fat32 for a friend who wants to use it in a sandisk mp3 player that of course is not compatible with exfatacting on sandisk advice i am returning the unopened class ten cards with the komputerbay reader i spoke with a patient and gracious tierone tech support person and the party line seems be that consumers only use microsd cards in phones i do not know what they are thinking cameras mp3 players tablets adapters and so on anyway it is a known issuei can confirm that the class 6 64gb microsd card can be formatted in windows7 back and forth to most any format so after returning four class 10 cards i am back to class sixit is still unconscionable to deliberately design these cards to be incompatible i hope sandisk will come up with a solution or recall the cards buyer bewareupdate 92912i received my two replacement class 6 64gb microsd cards and it took less than five minutes to open the horrible packaging and to perform a quick format to ntsf donei gave my friend the class 10 64gb microsd card formatted into fat32 by hpusbdiskexe and he could not read it on his computer as it turns out the class 10 cards are not only incompatible with most devices bur also with most usb card readers another trip across towni can confirm that the iogear sdmicrosdmmc card readerwriter gfr204sd greengray selling on amazon for 699 works so after countless hours of wasted effort my friend has a card formatted to fat32 that works with a sandisk mp3 playeronce again sandisk has admitted that these cards are not compatible with androd 40 or above that being 100 of android tablets and a majority of android phones these cards are intentionally crippled by designto quote a friendper the sdhc standard the format is fat32 sdxc 64 gb and larger the spec calls for exfat microsoft has limited the os to only format larger cards as exfat and will not allow fat32 also seems they have found a way to also block ntfs thus far very few android devices can read exfat because they refuse to pay m for licensing of the exfat file system to all masochists out therebuy this card to everyone elseunsafe at any speed,1.0

horrible shippingi ordered two 32gb and two 64gb versions of these memory cards but i can write only one review per amazon two 32gb cards went into a camera and a cell phone which only accept up to 32gb cards and one 64gb card went into my samsung galaxy s3 cell phone the second 64gb cards a sparethe galaxy s3 phone accepted the 64gb microsd card with no problems except for the fact that my galaxy s3 only recognizes 597gb of the 64gb microsd card i have no idea why it does that and why i lost over 5gb of an empty microsd card but i am okay with that i guess 60gbs is still plenty the transfers of music videos and pictures between the phones internal 16gb memory and the 64gb microsd card is way faster than the old sandisk 16gb microsd card that was in there the same noticeably faster speeds between my desktop computer and the 64gb microsd card were also smile inspiringas for the sandisk microsd cards they work great and seem to operate pretty darn fast they are definitely faster than the old 16gb sandisk microsd cards i had installed in my camera and cell phonesnow as for the shipping dismal i ordered two 32gb along with two 64gb microsd cards on august 21 during an amazon gold box sale according to the tracking feature they did not even transmit the shipping info to the carrier usps until august 31 all four were shipped together i did not receive them until september 6 a full 16 days after i ordered a little over two weeks for four tiny items that were indicated on the amazon page as being in stock ships from and sold by amazoncom at the time of purchase they also shipped all four tiny microsd card packages in a way oversized box which the usps could not fit into the mailbox so i had to make a crosstown trip to the us post office and stand in a very long and slow moving line to pick up the box they could have all four easily fit in one small envelope even a small padded envelope i left packaging feedback on that alreadythis is the 3rd straight time that amazon shipping was horrible over the last several months and that is why the 2star rating this is not the amazon shipping that i remember,2.0

sandisk ultra 64 gb microsdxc class 10im using this in a samsung galaxy s3 16gb unlocked smartphone and the only problem is as you write more and more flies to the card it gets slower and slower to the point that youll be so po at a crucial moment say for example you want to access a video or doc that when you do actually get your file youve lost all faith in the card so buy it for the capacity but always remember it is not reliable for fast access,3.0

super high capacity excellent price on amazon and it works great with my note 2sandisk announcement of the first 128gb micro sd took internet by storm our phones evolved into multimedia powerhouses with 556 displays desktop grade processing power otg support for external peripheral accessories powerful cameras and more the only thing was missing a super high capacity internal removable storage at an affordable price 128gb micro sd announcement finally filled that gap supported by amazon current sale of 119 shipped but the question still remained if some of the older smartphones will be able to handlerecognize this capacity i was personally curious considering original note 2 spec was calling for support of up to 64gb onlynow about the card itself its their ultra edition with a read speeds of up 30mbs and class 10 performance as part of ultra edition it is considered to be waterproof temperatureproof xrayproof magnetproof and also shockproof in addition to a flash card itself it also includes sd adapter for compatibility with digital cameras and also direct reading on laptopspcs support sd cardso here comes the verdict it works with note 2 my note 2 is all stock verizon schi605 version running stock android 43 i checked the card first with an adapter on my laptop and then mounted it on my note 2 where it was recognized with a right capacity i also ran a1 sd benchmark application both long and accurate benchmark tests to verify it with success readwrite speed were not quite near 30mbs but it is still pretty goodmy opinion this card takes multimedia powerhouse note 2 to the next level now you do not have to be limited and can store your favorite albums in flac audio format or have a small library of your favorite movies stored permanently or take more high def videos and so on just always stay up to date with backups if flash card fails it will be covered under warranty but your pictures and videos will be lost forever,5.0

sandisk makes a mean sdxcseries of microusb chipspeople often ask me about bargainbasement pricing on noname brands of media and you know i just have to cite my own experiences with cheap media and it is just that cheap media prone to failure or worse if it is a complex format as this one is the sdxc format they have crammed a ton of memory modules in that little bujgger you know i say go with experience go with a leader in the field so there is pretty much sandisk at the top of the heap and the rest trail far far behind in volume and precision assembly techniquesso i vote for sandisk every time and unless my experience is changed by some anomaly i will keep on recommending sandisk above all othersit is rated at 40mbsec write speed which is enough to keep up with even the fastest real camera or phone camera out there in the wild and it certainly keeps up with my samsung note 3s 13megapixel rocket camera one that shoots up to 8fps in burst mode taking certain shots so if it works for that camera perfect chances are it will work for your setup great alsobuying the sandisk memory module costs what 57 more than the others max right i say buy this one here it is a winner in all respectswavey davey 1122014,5.0

worked right out of the package in my asus tf700t tableti bought this because i needed more storage for asus tf700t tablet and this was the largest capacity microsd card i could find card came preformated with the exfat file system which is recognized by the asus tf700t tablet and many other android devices the only reason i take a star off is because i cannot attain transfer speeds anywhere near the 30 mbs that sandisk claims i averaged around 8 mbs which is fine for utilizing media on the tablet but made the initial transfer of 30gb of files onto the card a slow process,4.0
not bad had a few problems but not anymorethe 32gb holds alot and when they say that this memory card is fast they mean it holds everything i need on my android phone and works well with it had a few issues with the phone primarily but it was resolved when i reset the phone note the phone is an old sony xperia ion lt28a and has had issues from overuse so i needed to reset it regardless of the memory card once i finished setting up the phone and memory card from factory specs the devices worked like a charm still would not overrate it though so 3 like most of my other reviews,3.0

sufficient space for my ever growing music libraryi am using the fiio x5 and my current 64 gb sd card is full my library is now bigger than 150 gb and this sandisk 128 gb card had a price drop to 100 and with free shipping it was a nobrainer to get it to accommodate all my music files it worked as advertised and speed can be further improved but then i am limited by the read speed of my player x5 overall a good product with the big memory space which filled my needs recommended to buy again if there is a discounted price for this card else get 2 x 64 gb card which is still cheaper than a 128 gb sd card,5.0

awesomemost mobile devices and tablets that are of any count state that the limit to their sd storage is 32gbbut on a few of those they can and do read sd cards that are in fact larger than this i would suggest anyone that thinks they need space beyond those stated limits of their device do a quick search on line for their particular make and model cellphone or tablet to see what size sds others have been successful at using once you have found out and that you can in fact use such an sdgo and search online for hdd raw copy tool from hdd guruand it will allow you to make an image of your old sd to apply to the new sd andor even make a backup of ones sd since the sd drives are different sizes when this image is applied to the largeryou will need to use a partition manager such as minitool partition wizard which is free for home use and resize the partition of the larger drive this will allow you to take advantage of the whole drive space i love the upgrade and added spacecannot go wrong with this price for a class 10 sd of this size,5.0

ultra fast reliable and cheap 55i bought it for just 23 usd it is very fast and reliable simply the best option for a 10 class micro sd of 32gbupdate11082013dont buy it for using it on a samsung galaxy s3 there is seem to be an issue between the phone an this particular reference that makes that after a while the microsd card lost its data and get nonfunctional i cannot be repair after that so it gets totally useless you can tell the card is going to fail before it is too late because constantly the phone shows a notification indicating that the card was ejected and it needs to be mounted again when this happens i strongly recommend you to backup your data and change the microsd card of your phone and use it in other device before it gets corrupted,5.0

good memory adapter yikesthis is a class 10 microsd card and it works just as advertised it is very fast good for recording hd video and such it is pretty decently priced per gig for a card of its classhowever beware that adapter that comes with it put the card in good luck getting it back out i made the mistake of doing this to test the memory on my laptop and actually had to resort to pliers to pull them out which is probably not a great way to keep the chip in tiptop shape note i also said them there i got two of these and they were both that way so i doubt it was just a manufacturing defectbuy the memory throw away the adapters seriously they are dangerous to use and for all intents and purposes convert it into a standard sd card permanentlyproreliablefastgood priceconadapter it is a trap,4.0

it worked good until return policy was outhellogreat card great price plenty of speed and worked forabout a year in fact i wish it had stopped working a month earlierit looks like sandisk is out to make sure their cards stop working perfectly after the return window is up or something because now on the end of december return window expired about 20 days ago this thing only intermittently is recognized it unmounts all the time in my phone and then gets remounted and usually it does not even remountwhile it was a good price it was a good price for a name brand card that would have lasted longer than a year instead of sandisk going ahaha got you good now you have to buy another expensive namebrand cardnope i will buy a cheaper alternative and it will probably last longer i still have some kingstons going strong,1.0

great extra storage space for your tableti purchased the sandisk ultra 32gb microsdhc for some extra storage room for my samsung galaxy note 101 tablet i was considering the 64 gb but went with this card because i have the 64gb version on my galaxy note 2 phone and i have never come close to needing all that space granted i do not store any music on my phone but i do take a lot of photosvideos and store as many applications on the microsdhc card rather than use the phones internal memoryfor the cost savings of going with the smaller 32gb card it was a no brainerthe card has worked flawlessly since i installed it on my tablet and have had no problems with it whatsoever plus sandisk is a big name in storage so again it is a no brainer buy it,4.0
